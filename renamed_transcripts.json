    "video_1": "Welcome everyone. This is the first lecture\nof the course called hydraulic engineering\nand I will start with fluid properties. My\nname is Mohammad Saud Afzal. I am a faculty\nat department of Civil Engineering in IIT\nKharagpur.\nSo to start, one of the most basic things\nthat we need to know about the properties\nor the dimensions and units. As you have already\nread before in your class 10th and 12th the\ndimensions of each term on the 2 sides of\nan equation have to be the same. That is the\nmost important requirement for the dimensional\nanalysis. Some of the common dimensions of\nmechanics are length which is denoted by L,\ntime which is denoted by time, mass which\nis denoted by M.\nThese are the 3 basic dimensions that we generally\nconsider, force is given by mass into acceleration\nand in terms of dimensions it can be written\nas MLT – 2 because mass is M and acceleration\nis rate of change of velocity which gives\nLT - 2, temperature is denoted by theta.\nSo, some of the important quantities symbols\nand their dimensions are given. Velocity is\ngiven by v, it is dimensions are LT to the\npower – 1. Acceleration similarly, as we\nseen the last slide is LT – 2. Area is given\nby L square, volume is length cube, the discharge\nis L cube T – 1, pressure is ML - 1 T - 2\nand gravity is LT - 2. So, you should be able\nto show some of these properties by doing\nthis analysis by writing the basic equations.\nFor example, what you can do is…for example,\npressure is given by force divided by area.\nSo, you can write down the dimensions of force\nyou can break up force into mass into acceleration\ndivided by area. So, mass basic dimensions\nyou know, acceleration, you know and area\nalso you know, so, for example, pressure comes\nout to be M L - 1 T - 2.\nSo, density is given by rho, its dimension\nis ML- 3 its specific weight is given as gamma,\nwe will come to that what specific weight\nis dynamic viscosity is the dimension, these\nare some of the more complex quantities for\nwhich we have simply written down the dimentions,\nbut you can actually derive it, we will see,\nkinematic viscosity nu is given as L square\nT – 1, surface tension sigma is MT – 2,\nbulk modulus of elasticity E, is given as\nML - 1 T - 2.\nSo, these are actually fluid properties, these\nare some of the most important ones. As I\nwas telling you I am going to tell what specific\nweight is, so specific weight can be related\nto the density by this equation, specific\nweight is a rho into g, and similarly, we\ncan relate kinematic viscosity and dynamic\nviscosity through density again. So, n here\nis nu, m is dynamic viscosity, m as can be\nseen in the slide.\nSo, nu is mu by rho, and now, as you can see\nsince we can relate density and specific weight\nthrough rho, and we can also relate dynamic\nviscosity and kinematic viscosity through\nrho. So, there are how many independent properties\none surface tension, second is bulk modulus\nof elasticity, one of the viscosities and\nyou can either choose density as specific\nso, that means there are only 4 independent\nproperties presented in this slide.\nWhat is the definition of a fluid? According\nto Young, Munson and Okiishi in their book,\n‘a fluid such as water or air, deforms continuously\nwhen acted on by shearing stresses of any\nmagnitude.’ One of the important word here\nto note is “deforms continuously”. So,\nthat is what a fluid is. So, I have a question,\nwhy is not still a fluid? Because the steel\ndoes not deform continuously, if a small force\nis applied and by definition, if you apply\nwhatever single force simple most force, the\nfluid will deform.\nNow, going to some of the density and specific\nweight just to give you a brief revision from\nbefore, density is defined as mass per unit\nvolume rho. So, this is called specific mass,\ndensity of water is 1000 kilogram per meter\ncube, density of air at atmospheric pressure\nand 15 degrees centigrade is given by this\ncurve, this is a function of the temperature.\nThis figure right now shows the variation\nof the density of air varying from 0 to 100.\nAnd this figure now, it shows a zoomed image.\nSo, what happens mostly between 0 and 20 the\nreason of doing this is, this is the temperature\nthat we encounter mostly 0 to 20 degrees in\nnature, especially in this part of India,\nit goes up to 30-35 as well, but this gives\nthe zoomed image, so that you are able to\nsee in detail how the pressure variation is.\nA specific weight of water that is called\ngamma is given as 1.22 kilogram per meter\ncube for air and specific weight of water\nis rho g 9806 Newton per meter cube.\nSo, proceeding to our next topic of the fluid\nproperties, it is important to note that we\ndefined fluid as the something that deforms.\nSo, we will see an example, where fluid deformation\nbetween parallel plates is done. So, this\nis the side view, where a force F is applied\nand the upper plate starts moving with velocity\nU and the thickness of the…the total thickness\nis given hear denoted as t. So, as I told\nyou force F causes the top plate to have velocity\nU.\nNow, what are the parameters can control how\nmuch force is required to get a desired velocity,\nas has been seen from the experiment, distance\nbetween the plates which is denoted as t is\nquite an important parameter. Area of the\nplate A is also very important parameter viscosity\nmu is also important parameter. But what happens\nif these parameter increases and what does\nF do. So, F is found out to be directly proportional\nto mu area speed, but inversely proportional\nto the distance between the plates.\nSo, these arrows indicate one the left side\nthat the parameters or the F increases on\nthe right hand side denotes this decreases.\nSo, for F to increase as you can see, on the\nleft hand side the distance between the plates\nshould go down or if the distance between\nthe plates go down the force will increase\nor if increase the area of the plate the force\ngoes up and if the viscosity of the fluid\nincreases then the force increases.\nShear stress, so force as we have seen in\nthe last slide is given as mu times A multiplied\nby U divided by the distance between the plate\nt. So, mu can be written as Ft by AU the dimensions\nof mu is Newton second per meter square, I\nthink you should do this derivation after\nthis lecture is finished at your own convenient\ntime. Shear stress now is actually defined\nas force by area, and this is this tangential\nforce per unit area and its dimension is Newton\nper meter square or units is Newton per meter\nsquare.\nShear stress therefore, can be written as\nmu U by t. What is U by t? U is the velocity,\nt is the distance between the plate, or we\ncan also call it as a rate of angular deformation.\nSo, the units of this is 1 by seconds, tau,\ntherefore, can be written as mu du by dy as\nwe have already said it is rate of angular\ndeformation. What is du by dy? It is change\nin velocity with respect to the distance as\nin terms of differential equation. So, shear\nstress is our general equation that relates\nsheer and viscosity. And this du by dy also\ncalled rate of shear.\nComing to fluid viscosity. Some examples of\nhighly viscous fluids are molasses, tar, if\nyou have more concentration of oil or glycerin,\nthese are some of the things which are highly\nviscous. So, what is the fundamental mechanism\nof viscosity in gases, it is due to the transfer\nof the molecular momentum. In case of gases,\nthe viscosity increases as temperature increases,\nalso the viscosity increases as the pressure\nalso increases, liquids, it happens due to\ncohesion and momentum transfer and here the\nviscosity decreases as temperature increases.\nIt is very important to note that it is quite\ndifferent from the gases where the viscosity\nincreases on increasing the temperature. Also\nthe viscosity in the liquid is relatively\nindependent of pressure, for example, incompressible\nfluid.\nNow, one of the examples that we will talk\nabout is used to measure the viscosity of\nthe water. It is a very standard experiment.\nSo, the inner cylinder in this particular\ncase I have broken it down in form of a numerical\nas well. So, the inner cylinder here is 10\ncentimeters in diameter, there is another\nouter cylinder as well. So, the inner cylinder\nbeing 10 centimeters in diameter and it rotates\nat 10 rotations per minute, the fluid layer\nin between those cylinders is 2 millimeters\nthick and the height at which it is 20 centimeter\nhigh\nIf it is given that the power required to\nturn the inner cylinder is 100 into 10 to\nthe power - 6 watt. What is the dynamic viscosity\nof the fluid? So, as you have seen one of\nthe equations that can be used to find out\nthe dynamic viscosities tau is equal to mu\ndu by dy and F is equal to mu AU by t. These\nare the same equation one is it in the differential\nform other in the form which we normally write\nwe require in this case as well.\nSo, for to be able to solve this I have written\nall the quantities that I know, radius 5 centimeters\nof the inner cylinder, thickness 2 millimeter,\nfluid height is 20 centimeters, power is 100\ninto 10 to the power - 6 watt and omega is\n10 rotations per minute. So, F is given as\nmu AU by t, we need to know what U is, U in\nthis case will be r omega or omega into r.\nSo, what actually is omega? Omega is 10 revolutions\nper minute into 2 pi radians by revolution\ninto minute by 60 second if you do this calculation\nit will come out to be 1.047 radians per second.\nOmega can be directly obtained from this rpm\nvalue. Now, we also need to find out what\nan area is, area is 2 pi r h. So, it will\nact up across all the surface of the cylinder,\nand we know the value of r we know the value\nof h. So, F is written as mu, A is written\nas 2 pi r h, and U is written as r omega,\nt is as it is. So, if we break it down this\nequation in terms of omega and r this is what\nwe get F is equal to mu multiplied by 2 pi,\nmultiplied by omega, multiplied by r square\nh divided by t, the power is F into V force\ninto velocity or F omega r in our case.\nSo, power can be written using the equations\nof F and P given above as mu 2 pi omega square\nr cube h by t. And using this equation if\nyou take t on the other side and 2 pi omega\nsquare r cube omega h down you can obtain\nmu as power into thickness divided by 2 pi\nomega squared r cube h and on substituting\nthe values P as 100 into 10 to the power - 6\nwatt thickness as 2 millimeters, omega we\nalready found out it was 1.047 and r cube,\nr is 5 centimeters or 0.05 meters, h is 0.2\nmeters, we can get 1.16 into 10 to the power\n- 3 Newton second per meter square.\nSo, this is one of the standard ways of finding\nthe viscosity of water or any fluid for that\npurpose. And that also demonstrate one of\nthe examples in real life how are you going\nto solve for the value of the viscosity.\nNow, what is the role of viscosity in statics?\nIts important to note that fluid at rest have\nno relative motion between layers of the fluid.\nRight? So, statics means rest. So, when the\nliquids do not move, there will be no velocity\ndifference between those 2 fluids. So, du\nby dy is 0. Therefore, the shear stress is\n0. In case of fluid statics and is independent\nof the fluid viscosity. In case of dynamic\nfluid viscosity is very important because\nthe water moves, different layers will have\ndifferent velocity and thus will be the velocity\ngradient du by dy.\nRefer Slide Time: (16:33)\nSo, now, as we briefly touch dynamic and kinematic\nviscosity, kinematic viscosity also called\nnu is a fluid property obtained by dividing\ndynamic viscosity mu by fluid density. So,\nmu and nu are related by fluid density. As\ngiven below, nu is mu by rho and if we write\nit in terms of unit, we get nu as meter square\nper second, as we have seen in the slides\nat the beginning of this lecture. This also\nhas a connection to Reynolds number. Reynolds\nnumber is a concept that we will study some\nweeks from now, but I think this is a fluid\nmechanics and hydraulics class so it is important\nto introduce the value. Reynolds number is\ngiven by rho VD by mu. And since, as we can\nsee from the above, that mu can be written\nas rho into nu, we can simply write Reynolds\nnumber as VD by nu V is the velocity, D is\ncharacteristic dimension or in case of a particle\nof sphere it could be a diameter and nu is\nthe kinematic viscosity of water.\nSo, we are actually going to solve couple\nof problems now, where you will see how to,\nyou know, be able to solve for the shear stress\nat under different conditions. So, the question\nsays the velocity distribution in a viscous\nflow over a plate is given by u is equal to\n4y – y square for y which is less than 2\nmeters. Here, u is velocity in meters per\nsecond at a point distance y from the plate\nif the coefficient of dynamic viscosity is\n1.5 Pascal second determine the shear stress\nat y is equal to 0 and advisable to 2 meters.\nOkay. So, how are we going to solve this?\nWe will so what is given is u is equal to\n4 y - y square. Right? So, therefore, the\nfirst step is always finding du by dy for\nfinding shear stress, this is very important.\nSo, using this equation here, if you do du\nby dy. So, going to the basic differential\nmathematics 4y will become as, so d dy 4y\n– y square will be d dy, I am going very\nslow for this one because I am not sure if\nit is too obvious for you. So, this can be\nwritten as 4 because this d dy of 4y, 4 is\na constant. So, this will turn out to be 4\nand d dy of 2 y square, 2 will come out. So,\nit will be 2y. Okay?\nThen we also know that shear stress tau is\nequal to mu du by dy, we have already found\nout du by dy and we already know what mu is.\nRight? So at y is equal to 0. So, at 0 what\nI do is I indicate shear stress at 0, as t\ntau 0, it will be given as. So, this will\ndu by dy will be 4, because 4 - 2 into 0 multiplied\nby dynamic viscosity which was 1.5. So this\ncomes out to be 6.0 Pascal second. In other\ncase, at y is equal to 2 meters. If you do\nhere 4 - 2 into 2 that comes to be 0. Therefore,\ntau at 2 will be mu 4 - 4 that is 0. So, this\nis the first question that is there. So, now\nwe can go and see.\nSo, this problem we were able to solve. Now,\nthere is one another problem related to this\nthe first part.\nAnd that also we are going to solve. So, what\nit says is a 90 Newton rectangular solid block\nslides down a 30 degree inclined plane, the\nplane is lubricated by a 30 millimeter thick\nfilm of oil of relative density 0.9 and viscosity\n8.0 poise, if the contact area is 0.3 meters\nsquare, estimate the terminal velocity of\nthe block. Here also as you can observe here\nthe most important part here is the viscosity.\nBecause of this viscosity there is going to\nbe friction or shear stress and then the block\nwill have some friction and therefore, because\nit will counter the weight of the gravity\nand which is generally taking the block down\nand then now, let us actually start how to\nyou know, solve this problem. So, we are going\nto divide screen again.\nSo, as last time it is important to always\nwrite down what are the things that are given.\nSo, we are given that the weight of the block\nis 90 Newton. One of the other things that\nwe can actually do is we can try to have a\nrough diagram, this is theta and this is the\nblock, suppose this is moving with velocity\nV or terminal velocity which has been achieved.\nSo, when it is moving down under the influence\nof the weight, there is a shear stress that\nis opposing the motion of the block and the\nweight will be acting W downwards.\nSo, you as you would recall you used to have\nsomething called free body diagram in your\nmechanics. This is very similar just to make\nthe block. So, weight is given. Lets assume\nV is the terminal velocity, which is the value\nthat is asked in the question and theta is\ngiven us 30 degrees. So this theta is actually\n30 degrees. So important to note that at the\nterminal velocity the sum of the forces acting\non the block in \nthe direction of its motion is 0. So, what\nhappens at the phenomenon called terminal\nvelocity? If there is the net force acting\non the block is 0 then only there will be\na terminal velocity. Otherwise, the block\nwill accelerate or deaccelerate depending\nupon in which direction the force is larger.\nSo, if we write down the force balance equation,\nso, we can see the weight is acting downwards.\nRight?\nSo, there will be a component of the weight\nacting in favor of the motion and that component\nis written as W sin theta and what is opposing\nthe motion is the shear stress tau. Right?\nSo, the force due to the shear stress is given\nby tau into A and that should be equal to\n0 in case of terminal velocity. Here tau is\nshear stress on the block, area is the area\nin contact area or the area of the block because\nthe whole area is in the contact and tau is\nmu du by dy or mu if the terminal velocity\nis V and y is the thickness h because that\nis the area that is in contact. So, h is \nthickness of oil film, mu is given as 8 poise\nor in terms of Pascal second.\nSo resuming mu is 8 poise. And in terms of\nPascal second is 0.8 Pascal second simple\nconversion, h is given in the question as\n3 millimeters or 3 into 10 to the power - 3\nmeters. This is quite important to note down\nbecause now I have a new screen so what I\nam going to write down are the some of the\nimportant equations that we have seen in the\nprevious white screen. So, one of the equations\nwas W sin theta - TA is equal to 0 and tau\nis equal to mu du by dy is equal to mu v by\nh. Okay? Here, area is given as 0.3 meter\nsquare.\nNow if we substitute the various values and\nabove equations, so W is 90 Newton it is given,\nsin 30 minus shear stress is mu that is 0.8\nV divided by h is given as 0.3 into 10 to\nthe power - 3 multiplied by area that is 0.3\nis equal to 0. So what we get, so bring this\nside V is 90 multiplied by 0.3 into 10 to\nthe power - 3 divided by 0.8 multiplied by\n0.3 or this becomes 45 by 80, so this will\nbe 0.5625 meters per second, we can verify\nthis equation the calculation but 90 sin 30\nwill be 45. And if you do 0.8 into 0.3 and\ndivide it by 0.3 into10 to the power - 3,\nthis will give you the value of 80.\nSo how this has been done? So this 45 comes\nfrom here and using these 2 this comes here.\nSo, I know it is, you can get confused, that\nis why I am trying to point it. So, this gives\nus the terminal velocity 0.5625 meters per\nsecond. Great. So, now we can proceed. So\nthese were the 2 problems that we decided\nto solve for this particular lecture. Now,\nthe next topic is going to be the fluid properties\nand this we will take up in the next class.\nThank you.",
    "video_2": "Welcome back, this is the second lecture and\nwe are going to study fluid properties again.\nSo, we in the last class we studied mainly\nthe shear stress and fluid viscosities So,\ntoday we will proceed a little further, this\nis for course called hydraulic engineering.\nSo, as we said that viscosity and other concepts\nare for all fluids and gas is also a fluid.\nSo, we will also see what a perfect gas law\nis you have studied that already in your class\n10th and 12th but this is these first 10 lectures\nare going to be a revision of your basics\nfluid mechanics course. So, I will go a little\nfast because I know you have already done\nit in your previous course called fluid mechanics,\nbut to make the course more complete these\ntopics are going to be covered again.\nSo, what does it say? If you remember it says\nPV is equal to nRT. Okay? Where P is pressure,\nV is volume, R is gas constant, T is temperature\nand n is the number of moles. R is a universal\ngas constant. Temperature is taken in Kelvin.\nThe value of R is given as 8.314 Newton meter\nper mol Kelvin. In the text, one of the textbooks\nthat we are referring Munson, Okiishi and\nYoung or Cengel, the R in the text has been\nwritten as R divided by M molecular mass of\nthe gas, where M gases molecular mass, M gas\nfor air is 0.029 kilogram per mole.\nCan you guess why? Why is this M gas for a\nreasonable? The reason lies in that air comprises\nof almost 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, the\nmolecular mass of nitrogen is 28 grams per\nmole and oxygen is 32 gram per mole. So, I\nam going to you know, so, if you see this\n32 is 28. So, this is 80%. Okay? So, this\nis how this value will come. Okay? So, proceeding\nto the next slide.\nOne of the important other property in terms\nof gases is bulk modulus of elasticity. So,\nwhat does bulk modulus elasticity do? It relates\nthe change in volume to the change in pressure.\nSo, bulk modulus of elasticity is defined\nas, so, you see Ev is - dp dv / V this is\nthe definition of bulk modulus of elasticity.\nYes, so we are going to the highlighter now.\nSo, this is the equation that we are going\nto come later and how do we get it? This is\nshown here after some more description of\nbulk modulus elasticity.\nThe changes in density at high pressure for\nexample, in terms of pressure waves is an\nexample is the sound wave and other is a water\nhammer. So, now, I promise that I will show\nyou how to come from this equation to this\nequation. So, we already know PV is equal\nto constant. So, on differentiation, we will\nget Pdv + vdp is equal to 0. And if you take\nPdv to the other side and do dp dv it comes\nout to be - P / v. Hence, Ev can be written\nas if you use this equation and substitute\nthe value of dp / dv, so, putting these 2\nequations together, we will get E v as pressure\nin this case. Okay? We can also say that,\nwhy dp divided by dV / V can be written as\ndp / rho. So, I will just go and now, so,\nif you see this equation dp / dv = - p / v,\nso we can if you bring p on this side and\ndv so it is dp / P is = - dv / v and this\nminus dv / v comes here and therefore E v\ncan be written as minus dp and dv / v is written\nas minus dp / p. Okay? So this becomes pressure,\nso now we proceed to the next slide. So how\nmuch does the water compress it is the same\nequation dV / V = - dp / E v.\nSo, this is the figure, which shows the bulk\nmodulus elasticity how it varies with the\ntemperature. So, as you can see the bulk modulus\nelasticity increases as the temperature increases\nto a certain value and then starts to decreasing\nthese are the normal ranges of temperature\nin air, 100 degrees is very rare but the most\ncommon ones are 0 to 30 degrees in India it\ncan be 0 to 40 degrees. So, for water, so,\nI am sorry this bulk modulus elasticity is\nfor water.\nSo, compression and expansion of gases. So,\none of the phenomenon’s is isothermal, which\nis constant temperature. So, what happens\nis pV equal to nRT, that equation we already\nknow So, pV is equal to nRT. So pV / n is\nagain RT which is constant. Okay? So, this\nis RT. So, V / n is directly proportional\nto 1/P or inversely proportional to p where\np is absolute pressure and v is specific volume.\nAnd therefore, we can also write P / rho is\nalso constant. So, we need to find out dp\n/ d rho for to be able to find out E v because\nE v is given as dp divided by d rho / rho.\nSo, p / rho is a constant. Right? So is dp\n/ d rho and dp / d rho when substituted, it\nwill give us E v is equal to P. So, more importantly\nfor isothermal process \nwhat you must remember is that E v is equal\nto pressure. This is most important finding\nof this particular slide.\nSo, we are going to look at other phenomenon\nor process called Isentropic where no heat\nis exchanged. In this case, the equation for\nisentropic process is given by p / rho to\nthe power k is equal to C where k is C p / C\nv. This is a very standard terminology in\nthermal physics that you have already seen\nin your class 10th and 12th. So, this is also\ncalled a specific heat ratio. So, if you do\ndp / d rho from this equation, you will get\nC k rho to the power k - 1 therefore dp / d\nrho will be p divided by rho to the power\nk multiplied by k rho to the power k - 1.\nWe are using the substituting the value of\nC in terms of p / rho to the power k and therefore,\ndp / d rho will come out to be kp / rho, or\nwe can also write E v, because, E v is given\nas dp / d rho / rho. Therefore, we have got\ndp / d rho as kp / rho divided by rho, so\nwe get kp more importantly E v in case of\nIsentropic process is given by kp, k is specific\nheat ratio. So for isothermal process, this\nis going back E v is P and for Isentropic\nprocess E v is kp, that is very important\nto note. Okay?\nSo another important thing that we should\nbe aware of speed of sound is speed of c is\ngiven as this is the formula dp / d rho and\nE v we know that it is dp divided by d rho\ndivided by rho. Now, we have to solve for\ndp / d rho. We already know from this equation\nthat E v / rho can be written as dp / d rho.\nRight? Therefore, if we put this equation\nin this equation, then we can get c as under\nroute E v / rho, where c is generally very\nlarge for compressible, I mean it is very\ndifficult to compress fluids because E v in\ncase of fluid is too much the bulk modulus.\nSo, we should be if we know this equation\nand we know what type of process is there\nwe should be easily able to find out the speed\nof sound\nSo, another concept is vapour pressure. So,\nthis is the variation of vapour pressure along\nwith the temperature as you see as you keep\non heating the temperature the vapour pressure\nincreases to a great extent at 40 degrees\nit is over 7000 Pascal, you would have observed\nthat on heating the water the molecules are\neasily able to escape. So, this is due to\nthe vapour pressure and to be you know, some\nof the key values that we must be aware in\nthese type of you know, courses is for example,\nwhat is the vapour pressure of water at 100\ndegrees centigrade it is 101 kilo Pascal,\nso, this is an important value to remember.\nOkay?\nAnother such properties, the surface tension.\nAn example here is that the pressure increases\nin a spherical droplet, this is the surface\nof a droplet for example, and this is yeah,\nsurface molecules that we are actually seeing\nhere. And the phenomenon that is going to\nhappen if you closely you know, area between\nyou know, these 2 molecules that we are enlarging\nand zooming. So, what is happening is there\nare 2 type of forces. So, there will be force\ndelta p into pi R square due to the pressure\ndifference.\nAnd the force of surface tension that will\nbe resisting, it is going to be 2 pi R into\nsigma. This is the standard surface tension\nthat you have read from before but I am repeating\nit again. So, in case of force balance, what\nis going to happen that this F sigma delta\np into pi R square should be equal to, so,\nthis is F sigma should be equal to the pressure\nforce and what does it give? It gives the\npressure difference in the droplet is 2 sigma\nby R, this is surface tension, radius is radius\nof the molecule or the drop or the bubble\nwhatever that is.\nSo, this as you can see from this curve, as\nsoon as you increase the temperature of the\nfluid or water the surface tension is going\ndown.\nSo, we have included an example of surface\ntension here, but, estimate the difference\nin pressure between the inside and outside\nof bubble of air in 20 degrees water 20 degrees\ncentigrade of water. The air bubble is 0.3\nmillimeters in diameter. So, we already know\nthe equation here sigma is given as 0.073\nNewton per meter and R is the radius 0.15\ninto 10 to the power minus 3.\nWe have already seen the equation delta p\nis 2 sigma / R. So, delta p 2 sigma is the\nvalue here and r is 0.15 that we have come\nup with this.\nSo, the pressure difference comes out to be\n970 Pascal’s. I think it is very simple\nto calculate. So, you can use your calculator\nor just your. So, what is the difference?\nWhat is the difference between the pressure\nin water droplet and pressure in an air bubble?\nSo, this is a question for you to think what\njust a hint it has something to do with the\nnumber of surfaces of air and water droplets.\nSo, this normally, you know, the revision\nof our fluid properties is complete and the\nbasics that we have seen. So, I try to have\na review in such cases where we are revising\nsomething. So, what we have done we have read\nabout viscosity, we have read that tau is\nequal to mu du / dy this is one of the most\nimportant equations actually, we have read\nabout density and specific weight density\nis rho specific weight is gamma that is rho\ng we have read about elasticity, bulk modulus\nof elasticity E v is dp / d rho / rho.\nWe have seen that for Isentropic, we have\nseen that for isothermal. And Isentropic and\nwe have also related that to the speed of\nsound. We have seen about vapour pressure,\nwe have seen about surface tension. And this\nwas one of the important equation delta p\nis equal to 2 sigma / R. So to review the\nproperties viscosity, density and specific\nweight, elasticity, vapour pressure and surface\ntension. These are the important properties\nthat we have read. Now I have included for\nyour convenience 4 different problems and\nencompassing all the concepts that we have\ndone.\nSo we will go into these questions one by\none. So the question says, in an experiment,\nthat tip of the glass tube with an internal\ndiameter of 2.0 millimeters is immersed to\na depth of 1.5 centimeters into a liquid of\nspecific gravity 0.85. Air is forced into\nthe tube to form a spherical bubble just at\nthe lower end of the tube, estimate the surface\ntension of the liquid if the air pressure\nin the bubble is 200 Newton per meter square.\nSo, how do we approach this problem? Okay?\nSo, first and the foremost thing that we should\nbe doing is drawing the diagram of whatever\npiece of information that is there which need\nto know.\nSo, what it says is so, this is water and\nthis is air is coming here. This is the bubble\nthat is 2 millimeter diameter. This is 2 millimeter\ndiameter and this is 1.5 centimeter. Okay.\nSo, the pressure inside the bubble is given\nas 200 Newton per meter square and it is also\ntold, pressure outside the bubble is given\nby 1.5 into 100 into 0.85 into 9790 that is\nthe specific weight, you see this length 1.5\ncentimeter here so 1.5 divided by 100 and\n2.85 is this specific gravity and this is\na specific weight. This comes out to be 124.8\nNewton per meter square.\nSo, what is the pressure difference now, between\ninside and outside, between inside and outside\nthe bubble is 200 minus 124.8. So, this is\nhere and this is here and this pressure difference\ncomes out to be 75.2 Newton per meter square.\nSo, what was the formula for the pressure\ndifference that we have seen in couple of\nslides before, that delta p is equal to 2\nsigma / R. So correct? So, using this equation,\nsigma can be written as, or we just substitute\nthe value this value is 75.2, this is equal\nto 2 sigma divided by R, R is 1/1000. This\nwill gives sigma as 0.0376 SI units. So, this\nis one of the examples of the surface tension\nforces. We can now\nSee that in this, we found out we will go,\nwe will select the pen and then this sigma\nhere came out to be 0.0376 SI units.\nNow we go to the next problem. It is also\nvery much related to the surface tension.\nSo, the problem says a very small quantity\nof liquid having a surface tension sigma forms\na circular spot of diameter D, between 2 glass\nplates separated by a small distance h. Obtain\nthe expression for the force required to pull\nthe plates apart.\nSo, as I said the most important thing to\ndo is to be able to draw whatever is given.\nSo, let us draw, 1 plate, 2 plates. So, this\nis the plate, this is liquid, this is given\nby h and this distance diameter D. So, these\nare the some of the figures that we already\nknow. So now what we say is let the pressure\ndifference between the ambient and that in\nfluid within the plate gap be delta p. Then\ndelta p can be given as p 1 - p 0 or pi D\nh delta p can be written as 2 sigma pi into\nD or delta p is equal to 2 sigma / h in our\ncase. So, if force required to pull the plates\napart is F, F can be written as pi D Square\n/ 4 multiplied by delta p and 2 pi D Square\nsigma by, we substitute the value of delta\np or it can also be written as pi / 2, D / h,\nsigma D. Sorry, I will write it again pi / 2,\nD / h, sigma D.\nSo writing the final equation here F. \nF that is required will be pi / 2, D / h,\nsigma D, sigma multiplied by D.\nNow we go to our next problem that is related\nto the air and the compression so, mostly\nrelated on the gas laws. So, air at 20 degrees\ncentigrade and 200 kilo Pascal contained in\na cylinder is compressed to half its volume.\nFind the pressure and the temperature inside\nthe cylinder of the process (a) isothermal\nand (b) if it is isentropic with k is equal\nto 1.4. So, okay, the best way to go is to\nhave the whiteboard. So, whiteboard is very\ngood.\nSo, (a) Isothermal process p1 v1 is equal\nto p2 v2 therefore p2 is equal to p1 v1 / v2\nor 200 into 1 / 0.5 is very simple to calculate\nand this is 400 kilo Pascal absolute temperature,\nbecause everything is given here. Because\nthis is isothermal process temperature will\nremain constant \nand therefore, T 2 is equal to T 1 is equal\nto 20 degrees centigrade. Right? The second\npart in isentropic process, what happens in\nthis isentropic process pv to the power k\nis constant. So, in this case p2 will come\nto be P1 multiplied by v1 / v2 to the power\nk.\nSo, 200 into this is 0.5, so it is compressed\nto half, so volume to the power 1.4 and if\nyou calculate this, it will come to out to\nbe 527.8 kilo Pascal. Now for temperature\npv is equal to RT and pv to the power k is\nconstant. So we can use this equation here\nand then we can write RT, v to the power k\n- 1 is equal to constant. Well I do get the\nnext page.\nSo if we use so what we found out in the last\nscreen was RT v to the power k - 1 is equal\nto constant or we are also able to write T\n2 / T 1 because R will be canceled on both\nsides, v 1 / v 2 divided by k to the power\nminus 1. We know that T 1 was 20 degrees centigrade\nor in Kelvin, it is going to be 273 + 20 is\nequal to 293 Kelvin and v1 / v2 is 2. And\nk - 1 will give out 1.4 - 1 as 0.4.\nSo on substituting these values, we can get\nT 1 is equal to 293 into 2 to the power 0.4\nor 386.6 Kelvin or T 1 is 386.6 - 273 that\nis 113.6 degrees Celsius. So, this is the\ntemperature that we have got in case of a\nisentropic process. So, what I would like\nto do is I would like to end our fluid properties\nlecture here if I get more time we can solve\none more problem at the end of this week's\nlecture, okay, thank you so much. See you\nin the next week lecture that will be on fluid\nstatics, and that will be spread over 3 different\nlectures. Thank you so much.",
    "video_3": "Welcome back to the lecture number 4 of this\nweek. Last week we stopped sorry last lecture\nwe stopped at differential manometers this\nwas the slide that we were going to talk about,\nwe saw some devices that can be used to measure\npressures one of them was manometers in which\na standard manometer and a differential manometer,\nso we are actually going to write down an\nequation or you can call it as a numerical\nas well, so this is the set up you know the\nblue one is this liquid here is water. And\nthis is mercury.\nSo we need to find out the drop in pressure\nbetween points 1 and 2. So how are we going\nto approach this problem, so where if you\nsee this is an orifice.\nSo now we are actually going to keep this\nfigure in a small and just write down start\nwriting down the equations variation with\npressure if we go down we are going to add\nthe pressure if we are going up we are going\nto subtract that pressure. So firstly P 1\nthis is P 1 here plus h 1 gamma w so what\nwe are we are traversing around this direction\nokay h 1 gamma w because this is water minus\nh 2, so if we travels around this direction\nand reach this point, so, minus h 2 into gamma\nHg again we are traversing across the water,\nso minus h 3 gamma w should be equal to P\n2 very very simple equation. Correct? So we\ncan write we can bring P 1 here, P 2 here,\nand we can write P 1 - P 2 is equal to as\nwritten here, h 3 - h 1 gamma w + h 2 gamma\nH g or we can also write P 1 - P 2, h 3 - h\n1 is what if you see h 3 - h 1 or minus of\nh 1 - h 3 will be h 2. Right?\nSo this can be written as minus h 2 this term\nhere. So it will be h 2 can be taken out and\nwe can write P 1 - P 2 is equal to h 2 gamma\nHg - gamma-water and this is the pressure\ndifference. Very very simple question on differential\nmanometers, and this is how it works. Okay?\nNice. So, this concludes my first part where\nthe pressure variation with location was their\npressure at a point.\nSo we are going to solve some questions also,\nand this is quite important. So, what we say\nwe have a 6 meter deep tank, so this is 6\nmeter, right? And contains 4 meters of water,\nso this is as it is written here very clear\n4 meter and 2 meter of oil of relative density\n0.88. So we have an oil the relative density\nis 0.88, we have to determine the pressure\nat the bottom of the tank. Okay? So, for your\nconvenience we have drawn the pressure variation\nhere on this side and this.Okay?\nSo how are we going to this is a question\nthat generally people do it for before in\nyou know engineering starts or you must also\nhave done it in a fluid mechanics class. So\nnow we are going to approach this and as always\nwhat I am going to do is I am going to use\na white screen.\nSo we have already seen this equation so I\nwill just draw the pressure prism I cannot\nshould not call it pressure prism but yes\nso this is p 2, right? The entire thing here\nthis is 2 meters, okay, so that, you remember\npressure at atmosphere is 0 this is 4 meters,\nokay, and this is p3 we need to find this\ncorrect. So these are all the information\nthat we have. So, first see steps are very\nimportant so you must be noting it down.\nFirst, determine the pressure while water\ninterface, that is, p2, so p2 is written as\np1 plus pressure \ndue to 2 meter of oil, very nice. So or p1\nplus what is the pressure due to 2 meters\nof oil, gamma 0 into 2. Correct? Here p1 is\nequal to 0, right? Whereas gamma not which\nis the pressure of the oil it is 0.88 specific\ngravity into 9790 that is 8615.2 Newton per\nmeter square and a Newton per meter cube sorry\nbecause this here.\nSo p2 can be written as 8615.2 into 2 that\ngives us 17230.4 Newton per meter square.\nSo, you do not have to be very specific about\n9790 you can also assume 9.8 so 9800 it is\njust what I have assumed, okay. So, that is\nthe first step now we must also determine\nP 3, right. gamma w is we have assumed 9790\nNewton per meter cube, okay. So p3 will be\np2 + pressure due to 4 meters of water, right.\nSo p2 we already know, correct? So, p2 value,\np2 is what we have found out was 17230.4 +\npressure due to 4 meters of water is going\nto be 4 into 9790, okay, that gives us 56390.4\nNewton per meter square, or p3 can be written\nas 56.39 kilo Pascal, okay. So, this was what\nthe question had asked to calculate p2 and\np3. If we just go back, you know, so determine\nthe pressure at the bottom of the tank so\nbottom of the tank was p3 and that is exactly\nwhat we have found out. So, the answer was\nP 3 is equal to 56.39 kilo Pascal, okay. So\nmaybe, so I have one another problem for you.\nBefore we go to the next concept, and that\nis, we have shown a manometer here in this\nfigure. We have to calculate the pressure\ndifference between points, M and N, this is\npoint M and this is point N. The best way\nas I told you before, if you want to calculate\nthe pressure difference or pressure at that\npoint you have to start at one point where\nthe pressure is known and traverse to the\nother point where you have to calculate the\npressure.\nIf you go up you have to subtract that pressure\nif you go down you have to add that pressure.\nSo, that is the one of the ways. Here, what\nwe are going to do, we are going to equate\nthe pressure at this level. okay. So, I think\nyou must be drawing this figure, because I\nwill not be redrawing it now. So but what\nI am going to do is, I am going to use that\nanother white sheet to be able to solve this\nproblem. Good. So, as I already told you we\nhave to equate.\nSo, equating the \npressures at both the limps as I told you,\nwhile discussing the figure along \nthe horizontal plane, and what is that plan,\nxx. So, pm - gamma w 0.06 + 0.035 will give\nus pN – gamma w 0.12 + 0.06 - gamma not\ninto 0.035. So here, gamma w is unit weight\nof water, which is equal to 9790 Newton per\nmeter cube. And this value has been assumed,\nokay. This is a standard value. What is gamma\nnot, is unit weight of oil. What is it going\nto be any guesses? The specific density was\n0.83 into 9790, specific gravity when we say\nit is always our density that is in ratio\nwith water no other fluid, okay.\nSo, that is why this the density of I mean\nunit weight of water is what we multiply to\nthe specific gravity to get the unit weight\nof that oil, so here it comes out to be 8125.7\nNewton per meter cube. So if we use these\n2 values in equation here what we are going\nto get pM - pN is equal to 9790 into 0.095\n- 9790 into 0.18 – 8125.7 into 0.035 and\nthis is going to give us - 1116.5 Newton per\nmeter square or - 1.1165 kilo Pascal. I mean,\nwe do not have to be very, you know, where\nwe can simply write 1.12 also. - 1.12 kilo\nPascal okay.\nSo, the answer is going to be because it is\nnegative that means pressure at N is larger\nthan at M by 1.12 kilo Pascal, simple. So,\nthe calculation of, you know, the pressure\nthings is not that difficult. If you follow\nthe chain rule, keep writing the pressure\nwhile going up and down this is very, very,\nvery, simple, great. So, now we go back and\nthis we have solved this problem now.\nSo, this is a fluid statics 2, I mean, I call\nit 2, because we are going to do the surface\nforces and body forces therefore we need to\nknow, what are we going to study in fluid\nstatics 2. So, in statics 2 its static surface\nforces, we are going to see force on plane\nareas, okay. We are going to see force on\ncurved surfaces, like this. So, this is plane\nareas, this is plane, this is curved surface\nand we also will see the buoyant force, a\nvery small detail of it, but I think this\nis very necessary. So, I mean, if we are teaching\nbasics of fluid mechanics in this course in\nthe beginning, so, buoyancy is an important\nconcept that everybody must be aware of. Good.\nSo, we have to see what are the forces on\nplane areas, that is horizontal surface. So,\nif you see, this is a figure that shows, you\nknow, a horizontal surface a depth h, okay.\nSo, this h is the vertical distance to free\nsurface and this we what is the P here, okay.\nAnd what is the resultant force at the bottom,\nokay, and P we are assuming 500 kilo Pascal's,\nokay, that we are going to see. So, what is\nthe force on the bottom of this tank of water\nactually, what is the net force on the bottom\nof this tank?\nSo, the force resultant force is going to\nbe the integration of pressure into area,\nSo, p is constant so it comes out and that\nbecomes pressure into area pA, where p is\nrho gh, okay, this is the gauge pressure.\nSo, F R will become rho g h into A, hA is\nthe volume, area into height that is the volume,\nright. So, F R is actually nothing but the\nweight of the overlying fluid, okay. Also\nF is normal to the surface and towards the\nsurface, if p is positive, okay.\nF passes through the centroid of the area.\nThis is an important information for you.\nAnd therefore, the change in pressure can\nbe equated to rho into a, okay, or we can\nwrite in x direction - Delta P by Delta x\nis equal to rho a x, right. So, there is no\nacceleration in x direction here, and that\nis equal to 0. There is no pressure variation\nin x direction whatever there is, it is in\nz direction. Good.\nAnother important thing is, we have to learn\nand revise again, what are the forces on the\nplane areas or the inclined surface. So, this\nhas to be taken in a little bit of more detail.\nWhat will be the direction of the force? Always\nperpendicular, normal to the plane, right.\nSo, the force will start acting like this,\ncorrect. What will be the magnitude of the\nforce? We have to integrate the pressure over\nthe entire area. Here, the pressure is no\nlonger constant, because it is not it is not\nat one elevation it is varying see, the h\nis changing here, here it is different, here\nit is different, here it is different.\nSo, what is the line of the action? So far\nto find the line of action, we have to do\nthe moment of the resultant force must be\nequal to the moment of the distributed pressure\nforce. We have to do the moment balance to\nfind the line of action we will see soon how\nare we going to tackle, that so I will just\nerase all ink on the slide. Good.\nSo, forces on plane areas, so this has been\ntaken actually from Munson, Young and Okkiishi\nthe derivation. So, but I think I will explain\none by one what those things are, So, the\nquestion, the biggest question is you have\nto determine the location direction and magnitude\nof the resultant force acting on one side\nof this area due to the liquid in contact\nwith water. If you see the body, okay. I will\njust erase because this was just to you know,\nokay, alright.\nWhat we say, let the plane in which the surface\nlies, intersect the free surface. So, this\nis the free surface here, okay, and let the\nplane in which the surface lies the body intersect\nat point O, okay, right. Good. And let this\nmake an angle theta with the surface, right.\nThe xy coordinate system is defined such that\nO is the origin. So, this is also the origin,\nyou know, and the x axis is directed along\nthe surface as shown so this is x axis, okay.\nSorry, this is x axis and this is y axis,\ngood. So, this is just explaining you, and\nwe are going to look at the individual terms\nwhen we describe those, you see many things\nhere, centroid, location of resultant forces,\nyou see this FR, you see dF, but we will come\nto it one by one, good.\nSo, what I have done is, I have kept this\nimage on the left side and how we are going\nto. So, for any depth h, okay. Let we say\nthat the force acting on an area dA will be\nbecause it is at depth h, dF will be pressure\ninto area right gamma h dA, this is the dF,\nthis is perpendicular to the surface, that\nis very important. So, to find out the resultant\nforce what should we do? We do gamma h dA\nintegrated over the entire area, right.\nh here, if we start if we try to write down\nin terms of Y this can be related to theta\nas h is y sin theta and gamma is gamma and\ndA is dA, okay. So, F R can be written as\ngamma sin theta can come out and this is y\ndA, okay, integral of y dA, very important,\nif you remember from your earlier classes,\nthis is first moment of inertia. And this\nintegral y dA can be written as y c into A,\nwhere y c is the location of the centroid\nof the object, right. And F R can be written\nas gamma A y c sin theta. So now, you know\ngamma, you know A, you know sin theta and\nfor a particular object you also know y c,\nthe centroid location, right. Where y c is\nthe coordinate of the centroid of the area\nA measured from x-axis which passes through\nO. So, orientation you have to be very careful\nabout, okay. I will just erase all the ink\nnow. So, or we can also say gamma A from here\nand y c sin theta. What is y c sin theta?\nThis is y c, right? y c sin theta can be written\nas h c, h c is the height of the centroid\nfrom the free surface.\nSo, h c is the vertical distance from fluid\nsurface to the centroid of the area. Now,\nwe have actually simplified into very common,\nI mean, very simple equation. I will erase,\nso I will just write the important one, so\nthis is the important one, F R is equal to\ngamma A h c this is one important result to\nnote down at this point in time. Very good.\nSo, we proceed to the next slide, okay. So,\nthis equation of F R suggests, that the magnitude\nof the resultant force is equal to the pressure\nat the centroid multiplied by total area.\nAs you have seen here, see, pressure gamma\nA multiplied by the total area, right. F R\nalso must be perpendicular to the surface\nthat is very important. And the reason is\nsince all the differential forces were perpendicular\nthat we have counted.\nIf you see, all the forces these were all\nperpendicular. So, this is let us say dF 1,\ndF 2, dF 3. So, if you add this the sum can\nchange, but not the direction, right. The\npoint through which the resultant force acts\nis called the center of pressure. This is\nyou might have heard in your fluid mechanics\nclass what calculate the center of pressure.\nSo, this is what the center of pressure is\na quick revision for you again. The center\nof pressure is not at the centroid. And what\nis the reason? Because the pressure is increasing\nwith depth, that is important again, another\nimportant result to note down, okay. We have\nseen the resultant force value and we have\ndiscussed some of the properties of resultant\nforce. Now, we must also be able to find out\nwhat corresponding x R\nand y R is. So, let us say there is the one\nof the coordinates in y direction for the\ncenter of pressure centroid is here this is\ncenter of pressure right is y R, which is\nnot equal to y c, okay. In that particular\ncase what we are going to do is, coordinate\ny R can be determined by summation of moment\naround x axis. So, for finding y R the moment\nequilibrium should be done around x axis.\nSo, the way we do it y R, F R. So, c y R into\nF R, so this is y r into F R, this will be\nequal to integral y dF, right. So, what is\ny dF?. So this is dF and this is y, so all\nthe summation beginning from here, until here,\nall these small small dF that is there. So,\nthat will be y can be written as, sorry, dF\ncan be written as gamma sin theta y dA, correct.\nThis we have already seen in the previous\nslide this is the sum of the moment, where\nF R was gamma Ay c sin theta that we have\nseen before. So, y R now can be written as,\nintegral y square dA divided by y c into A.\nI will erase the ink.\nSo, you can see integral y square dA, okay,\ndivided by y c into A, because gamma sin theta\ngamma sin theta cancels, right. So, this is\nactually the second moment of inertia with\nrespect to the x axis, very good. So, we are\ncoming at some conclusions now, where y R\ncan be written as I x second moment of inertia,\ncorrect. Now, if we use the parallel axis\ntheorem. So, because see this is around an\nx axis which is not fully independent of the\ncoordinate center, right system. But if we\nhave a coordinate system passing through the\ncentroid of the object, then we are able to\nyou know, calculate very easily does not matter\nhow do we orient our coordinate system.\nSo using parallel axis theorem I x can be\nwritten as I xc + Ayc square, very simple,\nthat, this you have read before as well. So,\nI xc is the second moment of inertia with\nrespect to an axis passing through the centroid\nand parallel to x axis, therefore, the equation\nof y R can be written as y c, is the centroid\nplus I xc divided by y c into A, I xc is known,\ny c is known and A is known, right.\nSo, this is an important let me, so, this\nis the important equation again. So, y R is\ny c + I xc divided by y c into A. If you remember\nthis equation you will always be able to find\nout the center of pressure coordinate y R.\nSo, we also need to find out X R. What is\nthe logical way? We will do the summation\nof moment around y axis now. So, for X R we\nneed to do the moment calculation around y\naxis so around this axis.\nHow? See, X R into F R. Where is X R? This\nis X R. So, X R into F R, okay. Because, yeah,\nis equal to integral x dF, so dF, we already\nknow. So, it is gamma sin theta y dA, right,\nand this is some of the moment we know, F\nR is this one, gamma A yc sin theta. Therefore,\nx R will come out to be integral x y d A / y\nc A, and this is the product of inertia I\nxy with respect to the x and y axis.\nTherefore, x R can be written as I x y / y\nc into A. Again the same thing happens that\nwe need to translate this moment of inertia\nor product of inertia I x y with respect to\nthe centroid, so that it becomes independent\nof that particular coordinate system. So,\nwe can write, if this is I x y, okay, I x\ny c can be written as I x y is equal to I\nx y at centroid plus A y c x c. If we put\nthis in this equation, here I x y c is the\nproduct of inertia with respect to an orthogonal\ncoordinate system passing through the centroid.\nAnd therefore x R can be written as x c +\nI x y c / y c into A so this is x c here what\nit comes. So, this is an important result\nhere, this is good. Another important result\nfor we have obtained y R and x R.\nNow, the center of pressure sum. If the submerged\narea is symmetrical with respect to axis passing\nthrough centroid and parallel to either x\nor y axis the resultant force must pass a\nlie along the x is equal to x c since I x\ny is identically 0. See, if the submerged\narea is symmetrical with respect to axis passing\nthrough the centroid, then Ix y is identically\n0. So, x r will be 0. Now, as the y c increases\nthe center of the y coordinate of the centroid\nincreases, center of pressure moves closer\nto the centroid of the area, very, very it\nis easy to see from the equation that y R\nwas y c +.\nYou know if yc is too large then does not\nmatter what the other term is. Since, yc is\nequal to hc by sin theta, y will increase\nif depth of submergence h c increases or for\na given depth the area is rotated such that\nan angle-theta decreases. This is very obvious\nfrom this particular equation.\nSo now, there are some properties of area,\nwhich you will be supplied with. This is very\neasy to know, hand on, you do not need to\nremember some other with this slide if you\nhad, so area in this particular of rectangle\narea is a b, depth of the centroid is a by\n2, I x c b a cube by 12. So, this is symmetric\nabout the centroid, right. So, I x y c is\n0, where I x c by A is a square by 12, I mean\nyou can just simply see. Similarly, for this\ntriangle, isosceles triangle, this is for\ncircle, I think, you can you know, note it\ndown these figures are quite important.\nThe circle for example, even objects like\nthis because in fluid mechanics in hydraulics\nyou will encounter structures like this having\nthis type of gate, ellipse is also important.\nSo area is Pi ab, y c is a, I x c is Pi b\na cube by 4, I x y c is 0, because it is also\nsymmetric around the centroid. Similarly,\nthis here, so this y c is 4R by 3 Pi, this\nvalue is important because, we are going to\nuse it because most of the gates that are\nused in hydraulics have these type of openings\nwe will come and we will see in this type\nof you know thing.\nSo, this is the probably the last slide of\nthis lecture I would want to each and every\none of you, this a very basic question, which\nI have taken from an English author, location\nof average pressure versus line of actions.\nWe will see in practice, how this moment and\nthose things are calculated with the help\nof these blocks. This is quite easy to understand.\nSo, my question is what is the average depth\nof the blocks? Anyone tell me what is the\naverage depth? So, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nSo, what is the average depth 3, right? Where\ndoes this average occur tell me? Where is\nthis average occurring the depth tell me?\nSo, it is happening at, see, at 5. Are you\nable to get this, right? See, this is, correct,\nto see that most number of the block number\n3 is at 5, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 8 9 10.\nSo if you take the depth. Now the most important,\nwhere is the resultant actually? How are you\nable to find this resultant? We will use moment\nbalance here.\nSo, correct? So, what we are going to do?\nWe are going to do y R into F R, resultant\nforce is equal to 1 meter. So, this is 1 meter.\nHow many blocks are there, tell me? 4 blocks\nplus, see, 1, 2 3, 4, okay? Now, 8 blocks\ninto 3 meters, right, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 into\n3 meters. Now we have 12 blocks, 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12 blocks that\n1. Similarly, we have 16 blocks we have 20\nblocks and if we do this summation so y R\nF R is equal to 380 meter blocks, okay. And\ntherefore, 380 meter blocks in the total number\nof blocks is 60 blocks.\nSo, we divide and we see y R will be 6.333\nmeters. So, this is quite an intriguing example,\nwhere you can practice it on your own. And\nif you do not understand, we will explain\nthat in the forum if you please, raise your\nquestions there, that is good. So now, I will\nend this particular lecture and we will proceed\nto the last lecture of our this week which\nis continuation of fluid statics where we\nwill see some more examples and how the forces\non the surfaces is calculated more, great,\nsee you.",
    "video_4": "Welcome back to this course of hydraulic engineering.\nThis week, we are going to cover basics of\nfluid mechanics, this is the second week of\nthis. So, we call this basics of fluid mechanics\ntwo the first topic in this series is going\nto be fluid kinematics.\nAnd yes we can proceed. So, first, we will\ntalk about the velocity field, what actually\nis this velocity field. You know, it from\nbeforehand but too thorough to brush up your\nconcepts will go through it once again. So,\nit is the actually the fluids can be assumed\nto be made up of in finite small particles\nand they are tightly packed together. And\nthis is implied by the continuum assumption.\nSo, infinite small particles of fluids are\ntightly packed together.\nThus, at any instant in time, a description\nof any fluid property, such as density, pressure,\nvelocity and acceleration, may be given as\na function of the fluids location. So, that\nis the basic assumption that is the basic\nthing that we are going to start with that\nthese properties such as density, pressure,\nvelocity and acceleration can be described\nas a function of fluids location. So, this\nis quite important to start with, the fluid\nlocation and properties such as density, pressure,\nvelocity and acceleration.\nSo, this representation of fluid parameters\nas function of a spatial coordinates is termed\nas field representation of the flow, the spatial\ncoordinate. So, that is, with respect to the\nspace. So, in terms of x, y and z. For example,\nthe velocity here can be written as u, u is\na fluid velocity or the fluid speed in i direction,\ni is x axis + v in j direction, j is y axis\nand w in k direction and each of u, v and\nw can be function of x, y, z and t, each of\nthose, this one, this one, and this one here.\nSo, as I told you, u and w are u, v and w\nare x, y and Z components, u, v and w of the\nvelocity vector. By definition, the velocity\nof the particle is the time rate of change\nof the position vector for that particle.\nSo, the velocity is the time rate of change\nof the position vector for that particular\nparticle, this you already know.\nSo, there is one figure here, we as you look\ninto the figure, x axis is in this direction,\ny axis is in this direction and Z axis is\nin this direction. The position of the particle\na, so a is our particle here, this one and\nthis one. So, these particles have the same\nparticle, but at 2 different times, at time\nt and at time t plus delta t and this red\nline here represents the particle path. Let,\nme just see if I am able to do this, yes.\nSo, this one here, is the particle path.\nSo, this, the position of this particle is\ngiven by the position vector, this which are\nof rA at time t, this is the position vector.\nAnd here at time t + delta t, this is r A\nat time t plus delta t. So, I will go back\nhere. So, so this is the position vector at\ntime t and this is the position vector different\nposition vector at time t plus delta t. So,\nconsidering the particle is moving so, particle\nhas moved from this point to this point via\nthis.\nSo, time derivative of this position, let\nme take out the ink first yeah. So, the time\nderivative of this position gives the velocity\nof the particle. So, time derivative of d\nr A is given by d r A d t / d t is equal to\nV A. So, velocity at point A or is the same\nthing what I have written and which is given\non the slide as well.\nSo, by writing the velocity of all the particles,\nwe can obtain the field description of the\nvelocity. So, if we write the velocity of\nall the particles in the system, we can obtain\nthe field description of the velocity vector\nv as this v is equal to v as a function of\nx, y, z and t using the equation described\nin the previous slide. Since, the velocity\nis a vector, it has both a direction and the\nmagnitude, this is the basic concept that\nyou know from before. The magnitude of V is\ngiven by modulus of V under root u square\n+ v square + w square, this is simply nothing\nbut the speed of the fluid.\nSo, assuming a particle has a velocity here,\nthis is the let us assume 2 direction, this\nis x and this is y. So, there will be a component\nand this is cos theta. So, this speed will\nbe mod of v. So, if this is let us say, u1\nis the x component of the velocity and u and\nv1 is the y component of the velocity, so\nmodulus of V in 2 directions will be u1 square\n+ v1 square this you already know.\nSo, now there are certain descriptions of\nthe flow, the 2 most famous are Eulerian and\nLagrangian. So, we will revise that as well.\nWhat is the Eulerion flow description and\nwhat is the Lagrangian flow description? So,\nas I told there are 2 general approaches in\nanalyzing fluid mechanics problems, the first\nmethod is called Eulerian method. In this\ncase, the fluid motion is given by completely\nprescribing the necessary properties as a\nfunction of space and time.\nSo, pressure, density, velocity, whatever\nproperties you have, even acceleration are\nprescribed by describing them as a function\nof space and time. From this method, we obtain\ninformations about the flow in terms of what\nhappens at fixed point in space as the fluid\nflows through those points. So, this is very\nimportant. So, this is the main difference\nbetween the 2 descriptions. In Eulerian flow\ndescription; we describe the flow properties\nin terms of what happens at fixed points in\nspace.\nThe observation is also taken from the fixed\npoint in space suppose; we define a coordinate\nsystem from beforehand and all the things\nthat are observed from the observer. So, this\nis x, this is y and this is z. So, if we if\nwe put our observer here, for example, anywhere\nand it does not necessarily need to be at\norigin, and if we keep on observing suppose\na particle is moving like this, if we keep\nobserving from here, and we see what is happening\nat this particular point at a fixed point\nhere, the flow description properties are\nEulerian and in nature. Good.\nSo, a typical Eulerian representation of the\nflow is shown by the figure, this one which\ninvolves the flow past an airfoil at an angle\nof attack. This is just to show Eulerian representation\nthis is flow past an airfoil. You see, this\nis a foil, this is an object and this is the\nflow properties or the contour that are there.\nSo, the way we have described it as one of\nthe observer at a fixed point in space, this\nis Eulerian in nature. The pressure field\nis indicated by a contour plot showing the\nlines of constant pressure, with gray shading\nindicating the intensity of the pressure.\nSo, this is the flow and this is the pressure\ncontour, you know. So, just want to make it\nvery clear that all these results have been\nobserved and obtained from previous experiments.\nSo, this is just to show how we describe these\nEulerian velocities for example or the pressure\nin this case, here.\nNow, what is Lagrangian flow description?\nSo, the second method called the Lagrangian\nmethod here, involves following individual\nfluid particle as they move about and determining\nhow the fluid properties associated with these\nparticle changes as a function of time. So,\nthe key component is, is following the individual\nfluid particles. So, our frame of reference\nis fixed at one of the particle that is moving.\nSo, that means, it is a non it could be a\nnon Newtonian frame of reference. Earlier,\nwe had a fixed in Eulerian we had a fixed\npoint in space from where we were making the\nobservation about a fixed point. Here, we\nare following an individual fluid particle,\nso, our frame of reference x, y, z is that\nthe particle itself. So, whatever motion we\nare observing is relative to that particular\nparticle. And this flow description is called\nthe Lagrangian method.\nAnd this is observed as a of this particle\nas a function of time. That is the fluid particles\nare tagged or tagged means just putting a\nmarker on them or identified and their properties\nare determined as they move. So, just to summarize\nagain, the difference between Eulerion and\nLagrangian flow descriptions is that, Eulerion\nis description is a description taken from\na fixed point space. However, in Lagrangian\nand flow description, the frame of reference\nis fixed to a moving particle. So, the difference\nbetween as I said the 2 methods of analyzing\nfluid flow problems can be seen an example\nof smoke discharging from a chimney.\nSo, talking about one, two and three dimensional\nflows, generally, a fluid flow is rather complex\n3 dimensional and a time dependent phenomena.\nAny fluid flow in real life is all the 3,\nit is complex 3 dimensional and time dependent\nphenomenon that means, the velocity will be\na function of time, it will have a velocity\ncomponent. So, this is time dependent means\nas a function of time. Three dimensional means\nit will have x, y and z all the 3 components\nwould be there as indicated write this equation\nV as a function of x y z.\nWhich can be written as u, u is the velocity\ncomponent in x direction, v is the velocity\ncomponent in y direction and w is the velocity\ncomponent in z direction. So, i j and k are\nthe unit vectors in x y and z direction, from\nyour maths class you would already be knowing\nthat modulus of i is 1, modulus of j is 1\nand modulus of k is also 1 if we write the\nvectors here. So, this is just a basic revision.\nSo, i j and k by multiplying i j and k we\ndo not change the magnitude but just try to\nshow the direction. Let, me rub this.\nSo, actually in almost any flow situations,\nthe velocity field contains all the 3 velocity\ncomponents, u v and w. In many situations,\nthe 3 dimensional flow characteristics are\nimportant in terms of physical effects they\nproduce. For these situations, it is necessary\nto analyze the flow in its complete 3 dimensional\ncharacter. So, for many flows in nature, 3\ndimensional flows actually are very important\nand therefore, we need to analyze in all the\n3 direction that is why u v and w all are\nimportant.\nThe flow of air past an airplane wing provides\nan example of a complex 3 dimensional flow,\nhow? Because aero plane is moving, so, the\nvelocity will be changing also in time and\nalso because the plane is also moving the\nvelocity will also be a function of x y and\nz. At different points the velocity could\nbe really different. In many situations, one\nof the velocity components may be small. This\ncan happen anywhere.\nFor example, suppose, there is a large tank\nand there is a flow in x direction and the\ntank is infinite in the y direction. And in\nthat case, in one of the directions, if we\ndo not vary the give the speed in y direction\nthat component is going to be very small.\nSo, but just going back to the example, the\nmain part here is that in one of the velocity\ncomponents may be small relative to the other\ncomponent. In such situations of this kind,\nit may be reasonable to neglect the smaller\ncomponent and assume 2 dimensional flow.\nSo as I would repeat again we have talked\nthat all the flows in nature are 3 dimensional,\nbut some of the flows can be assumed to be\n2 dimensional, because one of the small one\nof the component would be very small in comparison\nto the other 2 components. And therefore,\nwe can say that this is a 2 dimensional flow.\nIn this case here, where we have written v\nis equal to u i cap + v j cap and we have\nneglected w cap because here it might have\nhappened that the w is very, very small then\nu comma v. And here, u and v both here are\nfunctions of x, y and of course, it could\nbe a function of time as well .\nIt is sometimes possible to further simplify\na flow analysis by assuming that 2 of the\nvelocity components are negligible. So, we\nsaw that one component was negligible, but\nthere can be situations where 2 of the flow\nvelocity components are negligible, which\nwould leave the velocity field to be approximated\nas one dimensional flow field, that is v is\nequal to u i cap, this means, that v and w\nare very small than u. So, this is one dimensional\nflow in reality such flows can be there but\nit has to be very properly experimentally\ncontrolled, but in general as I said that\nthe velocity is 3 dimensional in nature.\nSo, we have talked about some velocity descriptions,\nnow, Eulerian, Lagrangian, and then we talked\nabout 3 dimensional flow, 2 dimensional flow,\n1 dimensional flow, now, it is time to talk\nabout steady and unsteady flow. So, as you\nknow from before probably from your fluid\nmechanics class is steady flow and unsteady\nflow, the main distinguishing component here\nshould be time. How? That we are going to\nsee. So, one classification of the flow is\nsteady and unsteady.\nIn steady flow what happens is the fluid flow\nconditions at any point do not change with\ntime, this is very important, do not change\nwith time. For example, if the velocity component,\nvelocity is v, pressure is given by p and\ndensity is given by rho. So, the derivative\nwith respect to time is going to be 0, there\nis no change in velocity, this means that,\nthe change in, let me just go to the laser\npointer, the change in velocity here with\nrespect to time is 0. Same is the case with\nthe pressure; the change in pressure with\nrespect to the time here is equal to 0 and\nthe same fate is for the density. The change\nin density with respect to the time again\nhere is 0. So, here and here.\nSo, in steady flow, stream line path line\nand streak lines are identical. We will, so,\nthis is actually stream line not steam line.\nSorry for the typo here. Path line and streak\nline are identical, this we will tell you\nin upcoming slides that what exactly are stream\nlines, what is path line and what is streak\nline. Good. An unsteady flow, unlike steady\nflow the flow parameters at any point changes\nwith time that is any of the flow properties\neither it is velocity, so, del v / del t will\nsurely not be equal to 0 that is the definition\nof or any property even del acceleration by\ndel time is not equal to 0 or del pressure\nas we saw del, sorry, density del rho by del\nt is not equal to 0 and del p / delta t is\nalso not equal to 0.\nSo, we have seen steady and unsteady flow.\nNow, we are going to see uniform and non uniform\nflows, the definition of the uniform and non\nuniform flow. Uniform flow, the flow is defined\nas uniform flow when the flow field that is\nthe velocity and the other hydrodynamic parameters\ndo not change from point to point. So, in\na steady flow it was not changing with respect\nto time, here, these properties should not\nbe changing with respect to the space at any\ninstant of time.\nSo, uniform flow is the one, where the fluid\nproperties do not change with respect to the\nspace. For a uniform flow, the velocity is\na function of time only that is it. Which\ncan be expressed in Eulerian description as\nV as a function of V of t. So, V is not a\nfunction of V x y z t, but only V is a function\nof the t. So, these x y z component vanish\nwhen it is a uniform flow\nImplications for a uniform flow; there will\nbe no spatial distribution of hydrodynamic\nand other parameters, as we told, because\nthe parameters really does not depend upon\nthe location. Any hydrodynamic parameter will\nhave a unique value in the entire field, irrespective\nof whether it changes with time. Therefore,\nnow, we have 2 parameters here is space and\ntime, time was with if something depends upon\ntime, it will be unsteady, if something does\nnot depend upon time it will be steady.\nSo, combining the steady and unsteady with\nuniform and non uniform we can have either\nunsteady uniform flow, which means the velocity\nwill be the only a function of time, or actually\nit might not even change with time as well,\nthis type of flow can be called a steady uniform\nflow. So, the flow properties are neither\ngoing to change in space or with respect to\ntime. Good.\nNow, non uniform flow, when the velocity and\nother hydrodynamic parameters changes from\none point to the other, which is exact opposite\nof uniform flow. So, the properties in uniform\nflow were not dependent on the position of\nthe particle or from in these respect to the\nspace, but non-uniform flow it will change\nfrom one point to the other and such flows\nare called non uniform flows. These are the\nsome of the terms that you will be you will\nbe encountering again when we start doing\nthe open channel flow for example, that is\nwhy it is important to go through it once\nagain.\nNow, important points are for a non uniform\nflow, the changes with position may be found\neither in the direction of flow or in the\ndirection perpendicular to it. So, we have\nsaid that, for a non uniform flow, the particle\nproperties or the fluid part fluid particle\nproperties changes with position. So, position\nor the direction can be infinite, but generally,\nit is a customary in fluid mechanics to calculate\nthe changes in 2 directions. One direction\nis the flow direction.\nFlow direction means for example, the river\nflows say in one direction x direction, then\nwe will calculate the changes of the properties\nin the direction of the flow. In our case,\nit is x direction and the direction perpendicular\nto it. So, suppose, there is a river flowing\nlike this and our coordinate system is x and\ny, for example, this is 2 dimensional space.\nSo, the best way to calculate the changes\nis in this direction and this direction perpendicular.\nGood.\nSo, non uniformity in a direction perpendicular\nto the flow is always encountered near solid\nboundaries past which the fluid flows. We\nwill come across it later in our lectures,\nthat how near solid boundaries this velocity\ncomponent changes and that is one of the main\nreasons why near the solid boundaries we need\nto, you know, calculate the changes and thus\nthey introduce non uniformity in the direction\nperpendicular to the flow.\nSo, if suppose, an example is there is a plate\nthe fluid will be flowing like this. So, there\nwill be velocity here, but this plate is at\nrest, we will come to it later as well, but\nsince the fluid is flowing across this, then\nthis is at rest and the particle adjacent\nto it will try to be at rest as well or the\nparticle nearest to this plate will be at\nrest. Here, the velocity is suppose, V of\nthe river I mean the stream velocity here,\nis 0. So, as you can see during this distance\nthe velocity goes from V to 0. Good. Alright\nthen. Nice.\nReason, as I was telling you before for the,\nI mean, in the earlier point that we said,\nall fluids possess viscosity, sorry I will\nuse the pen, all fluid possess viscosity.\nViscosity in a layman's term or in a old term\ncan be said as friction in fluids for example,\nand because of the friction, this reduces\nthe relative velocity of the fluid, with respect,\nto the wall to 0 at solid boundary as I was\ntelling you and this condition is called as\na no slip condition and because of the no\nslip condition, there is a non uniformity\nof the flow in the y direction.\nNow, what is a stream line? In a fluid flow,\na continuous line so drawn that it is tangential\nto the velocity vector at every point is known\nas stream line. So, what is the streamline\nit is a continuous line such that this line\nis tangential to the velocity vector at every\npoint. So, if you draw such a hypothetical\nline this is called a stream line. Suppose,\nif the velocity vector is given by in i direction\nas u, in j direction as v and in k direction\nas w, better to write it like this, u i cap\n+ v j cap + w k cap.\nThen the differential equation of the stream\nline, this you have already done before but\nI will straight away go ahead and write the\nequation is dx / u is equal to dy / v is equal\nto dz / w. So, this is the equation of the\nstream line. Alright.\nSo, now, we will end this lecture with this\npractice problem, first, we will finish this\npractice problem and then finish it. The question\nis, in a flow the velocity vector is given\nby 3 x i cap + 4 y j cap and - 7 z k cap.\nThis means the U component is 3 x, Y component\nis 4 y, and Z component is minus, I will just\ndo the eraser, - 7 z .Now, the \nquestion is, determine the equation of this\nstream line passing through a point M and\nwhere M is given by 1, 4, 5, the procedure\nis very simple.\nWe have done this equation before, the equation\nwas the equation of the streamline is given\nby dx / u is equal to dy / v is equal to dz\n/ w this we have seen in the last slide. This\nis the most important equation and we already\nknow u, for example. So, we can write as I\nwrote before, u is 3x, v is 4y, w is 7z, very\nit is very important to note that we must\nbe writing these components whatever things\nwe know from before when we start solving\na problem we should be writing it down first.\nFor example, U is equal to 3 x we have written\nand so on. So, this equation can be written\nas d x / 3x is equal to dy / 4y is equal to\n- dz / 7z because Z was - 7z. Let, me take\naway this ink. Now, the procedure is we will\nsolve this one at a time, dx / 3x is equal\nto dy / 4y and secondly we are going to solve\nthis two.\nAnd when we integrate the first equation will\ncan be written as l n x / 3 is equal to l\nn y / 4 + ln C 1 dash, where C 1 dash is a\nconstant. And how do we obtain this C 1 that\nwill talk about it next. So, in other word,\nwe can simply write because all these are\nl n we can write, y is equal to C 1 into it\nx to the power 4 / 3. And on integrating the\nsecond equation as I told this one here, dy\n/ 4y is equal to - dz / 7z.\nSo, either we can do integrate these equation\nthe second, or we can also use this equation\nthese two equations together. So, in this\npractice problem we have taken the x and z.\nSo, this gives ln x / 3 is equal to - 1 / 7\nln Z + l n C 2 dash, where C 2 dash is again\na constant. So, we can get simply z is equal\nto C 2 divided by x to the power 7 / 3. So,\nthese are the 2 equations that we got correct.\nNow we need to obtain C 1 and C 2, what is\nthe way we have said?\nFind the equation of the stream line which\npasses through a point M, where the coordinate\nof M was given, x was 1 y was 4 and z was\n5. This also means that this 1 comma 4 comma\n5 should also be satisfying this equation\nand this equation, and on substituting in\ny in this equation, we can get C 1 because\ny here is 4, so, that is, 4 and X was 1, so\nwe have put 1 here, in this way, we get C\n1 is equal to 4.\nSimilarly, using 145 and putting it into z\nequation here again, C 2 can be written as\nZ multiplied by x to the power 7 / 3. Z is\n5, so, this is 5 here, and x was 1 again,\nand this gives C 2 as 5. So the stream line\npassing through M can be given by y to the\npower 4, x to the power 4 / 3, and Z is equal\nto 5 divided by x to the power 7 / 3. So this\nis the problem where we saw how to solve the\nstreamline equation. And this is enough for\ntoday. So we will resume in the next lecture.\nThank you so much for watching.",
    "video_5": "So, welcome back last class, we studied several\nconcepts and concluded our lecture on calculating\nthe stream lines the equation for the stream\nlines.\nAnd this is this slide where we finished.\nSo we will talk about more concepts now.\nIf you remember that we said something about\npath line in our last lecture that we are\ngoing to talk about it in the upcoming slides.\nSo, what actually are path lines? So, path\nline is the actual path, sorry, I will this\nshould have been chosen the pen, yes. So,\na path line is the actual path traveled by\nan individual fluid particle over some time\nperiod. So, this is actually the trajectory\nof the particle right.\nSo, the real path on which the particle travels.\nSo, path lines are the easiest of the flow\npatterns to understand and a path line is\na Lagrangian concept in that we simply follow\nthe path of the individual fluid particle\nas it moves around in the flow field. So,\nwhat we are doing, path line is can also be\nsaid as a Lagrangian concept because what\nwe do is we simply follow the path of an individual\nparticle as it moves around in the flow field.\nSo, for example, we see there is a fluid particle\nat t, that is, t start or we can also say\nt = 0 for example, and the particle is moving\nlike this. So, this is the path line and if\nyou want to know some intermediate at intermediate\npoint. This is the intermediate point and\nat the end this is t and this is just to show\nyou how the path line can look, it could be\nthe path line could be any shape, depends\nupon the fluid velocities and the fluid acceleration\nof the properties, but it is simply the path\ntraced by the individual fluid particles.\nSo, what we are doing here, we are simply\nfollowing that particle as it moves along\nthe fluid. Therefore, it is a Lagrangian concept.\nSo, a path line is the same as fluid particles\nmaterial position vector, x particle, y particle\nand z particle t traced out over a some finite\ntime interval. So, we integrate and we can\nobtain that.\n(Refer Slide Time 03:18)\nMoving to the next concept is streak lines.\nSo, what are streak lines? So, a streak line\nis the locus of the fluid particles that have\npassed sequentially through a prescribed point\nin flow. So, if we start tracing the fluid\nparticles that have passed sequentially through\na prescribed point in the flow. We will explain\nit a little more. So, streak lines are the\nmost common flow pattern generated in a physical\nexperiment.\nFor example, if you insert a small tube in\nthe flow and reduce a continuous stream of\ntracer fluid for example, dye in a water flow\nor smoke in an air flow we the observed pattern\nis a streaks line because we are seeing the\nlocus of that particle through a prescribed\npoint in the flow, because that the tracer\nis one specific point and we are following\nthat movement of that particle.\nFor example, this if you inject a dye or dye\nin case of water or smoke in case of an airflow\nand there is an object here, you know, and\nthis is the particle in which we have injected\nthe fluid particles, this one, so, it moves\nthis one, I mean, and this if we observe this\nthe locus or the path traced by this particle\nis called the streak lines. You can always\ngo to the YouTube and see one of the streak\nlines and yeah, it is this figure shows the\nstreak line formed by connecting all circles\ninto a smooth curve.\n(Refer Slide Time 05:18)\nNow, there is something called a stagnation\npoint. So, this is a very interesting point.\nSo, a point of interest in the study of kinematics\nof fluid is the occurrence of the points where\nthe fluid flow stops. So, as the name suggests\nstagnation, stagnation means something is\nstagnant or stopped.\nSo, those points are of very much importance.\nSo, one of the stagnation point could also\nbe the plate for example, because there also\nthe fluid flow stops right.\nSo, when a stationary body is immersed in\na fluid, the fluid is brought to stop at the\nnose of the bound nodes of the body, such\na point, where the fluid flow is brought to\nthe rest is known as stagnation point. My\none question to you is, what creates, what\nphysical phenomenon helps or is related to\nthe occurrence of the stagnation point? Suppose,\nthere is a solid object which is kept fixed\nin the fluid flow when the fluid touches this\nbody that point is called stagnation point.\nWhy?\nBecause last lecture, we read about a concept\nthat was called no slip condition because\nof the no slip condition, the adjacent fluid\nvelocity fluid particle, the velocity will\nalso be 0 because of no slip condition. So,\nthis is the stagnation point. In this example,\nin this figure 4, there is a wall here and\nthen there is air flow or the fluid flow,\nwhatever you want to call it is there when\nit encounters the wall the velocity here actually\nis 0, the flow is stopping or diverting. So,\nin this direction there is no flow and this\nis called the stagnation point.\n(Refer Slide Time 07:21)\nThus, a stagnation point is defined as a point\nin the flow field where the velocity is, this\nis the key point is identically 0. This means,\nthat the all the components of the velocity\nV that is u, v and w are identical is 0 at\nthis stagnation point. Some of it we will\nbe going to see in today's lecture or maybe\nin the weeks coming forward what the stagnation\npoint, where it can be used. Now, after all\nthese points, we move on from the velocity\ndescription to the acceleration part.\n(Refer Slide Time 08:05)\nSo, acceleration first thing to that you already\nknow is a vector. In natural coordinate system,\nthat is, we describe the acceleration along\nand across the stream line that we are going\nto see. Suppose, this is a streamline here,\nthis in figure 5, let me take the laser pointer\nhere. So, this is a streamline and this is\na direction s and this is the velocity v direction\nhere and this is the S direction velocity\nin change in velocity in s direction and this\nis the velocity change in the direction perpendicular.\nSo, acceleration when can be given as, so\nI go back to the pan, total derivative of\nvelocity with respective time, dv dt and not\ndel v del t. So, the total derivative of the\nvelocity is called the acceleration. In our\ncase here, it will be a vector sum of the\nacceleration along the stream line and perpendicular\nto the stream line same as velocity. Suppose,\nthe velocity there are 2 velocity directions,\nV s and V n with total velocity the speed\nis going to be V s square + V n square whole\nunder root.\nSo, in the tangential direction, this direction,\nin the tangential direction a s can be written\nas del V s / del t + V s del V s ds this you\nalready have derived in your fluid mechanics\nclass. So, this is the acceleration in s direction.\n(Refer Slide Time 10:25)\nAnd in the normal direction it is nothing\nthat it is del V n / delta t + V s square\n/ r, V n and V s are velocities in s and n\ndirection. Here, this r is the radius of curvature\nof the streamline at that point. This you\nwill we will solve some problems, maybe in\nthe upcoming, you know, lectures. Vs is the\ntangential component of the velocity V. This\nwe already talked and V n is the normal component\nof the velocity generated due to change in\ndirection.\nSo, normal V n the velocity, the velocity\ncomponent that is normal the term del V s\n/ del t and del V n / del t, this one and\nthis one are called local accelerations, and\nV s del V s / del s is the tangential convective\nacceleration and V s square / r is the normal\nconvective acceleration. This is quite some\ninformation to note. So, now what I am going\nto do highlight the most important one. So,\nlet us go to the previous slide.\nSo, this is an important equation. So, it\nis a combination of a s is a combination of\nlocal acceleration plus convective acceleration.\nIn the normal direction also the sum of local\nacceleration plus the normal this is also\nnormal convective acceleration. So, when we\nneed to calculate the total acceleration,\nwe should be calculating the corresponding\naccelerations, local accelerations and corresponding\nnormal convictive accelerations and the convective\nacceleration which is tangential and then\nwe will be able to solve the problems.\n(Refer Slide Time 12:42)\nSo, again in Cartesian coordinates, if we\nwrite the velocity I think, it is best again\nto write V as u i cap, here we have written\nthe velocity according, I mean, i cap, j cap\nbefore, it is also right, but better to. This\nis the normal convention. Acceleration a x\na y and a z in the x, y and z directions respectively\nare. So a x will be written as del u del t\n+ the this is local acceleration and this\npart is convective acceleration.\nSo, let me rub the ink. Similarly, for ay\nas well. So, del v del t + u del v del x +\nv del v del y + w del v del z these are in\nsome important equations that you should be\nremembering, a z will be del w delta t + u\ndel w del z. So, you see u u u u for a x,\nv v v v for a y and w w w w here for a z.\nSo, now, we will see a practice problem. So,\nthe question is, the velocity along the center\nline of a nozzle of length L is given by V\nis equal to 2t 1 - x / 2L whole square or\nI will write 2t 1 - x / 2L whole square. Here\nthe V is velocity in meters per second, time\nt in seconds and x is the, so, t is from t\nequal to 0, x is the distance from inlet to\nthe nozzle. So, and so, we have to find the\nconvective acceleration, local acceleration\nand total acceleration when t is equal to\n3 seconds x is equal 2.5 and l is equal to\n0.8. So, we have seen the equations previously\nand that we are going to utilize now.\n(Refer Slide Time 15:27)\nSo, the solution procedure goes as like this.\nLocal acceleration is given by del v del t.\nSo, so, del v del t if you see this equation\nhere, so, if you multiple if you do del v\ndel t, it is going to be 2t, this t will,\nyou know, this will become 2 times 1 - x / 2L\nwhole square and that is what exactly this\nis and at t is equal to 3 seconds and at x\nis equal to 0.5 meter, what we have done is\nwe have substituted the value of t is equal\nto 3 second and x is equal to 0.5 in this\nequation.\nSo, it is 2 will remain 2, 1 will remain x\nis 0.5 and length of length value we have\nbeen given 0.8 and this comes out to be as\n0.945 very simple multiplication is there.\nThis is the local acceleration. So, now, the\nconvective acceleration here is going to be,\nyou see, there is only one direction x so,\nthere will be only one velocity component,\nI mean, in convective velocity component and\nthat is going to be V del v / del x, so if\nV was, so, we knew that, I mean, the original\nequation says 2t 1 - x / 2L whole square right.\nSo, when we multiply V del v / del x, so,\nlet us write down V. So, this is V, correct,\n2t into 1 - x / 2L whole square and what is\ndel v del x. So, if you do if you differentiate\ndel v del x 2t will remain 2t. And this 2\nwill come down here on here and it will be\n1 - x / 2L multiplied by this x will become\nminus 1 / 2L and on simplification I will\njust erase the. So, this on simplification\nwill give minus 4t square / L into 1 - x / 2L\nwhole cube. So, what needs to be done very\nsimply.\nSimply, we need to substitute the value of\nt L and x to get our, so, substitute the value\nof t L and x to get convective acceleration.\nSo, at t is equal to 3 second and x is equal\nto 0.5 meter, convective acceleration will\nbe minus 14.623 meters per second square.\nSo, the total acceleration is going to be\nlocal plus convective acceleration. You can\nsimply do the arithmetic sum I generally prefer\nto write these accelerations separately. So,\nif you write this one and this one separately,\nit is fine. Here, we have simply added them\nbecause the total is the sum of both the accelerations.\n(Refer Slide Time 19:18)\nSo, going to another concept, that is, continuity\nequation. So, in one dimensional analysis,\nwhat we see is, in a steady flow mass rate\nof flow into the stream tube is equal to the\nmass rate of flow out of the tube. So, whatever\ngoes comes in goes out of the tube for example,\nin a steady flow. So, in one dimensional the\ncontinuity equation says rho 1, A 1, V 1 is\nequal to rho 2, A 2, V 2 this is the continuity\nequation.\nFor incompressible fluid under a steady flow,\nsteady flow we know that not a function of\ntime. But what is incompressible fluid? Density\nremains constant, so, the density does not\nchanges, so, rho 1 will be equal to rho 2.\nSo, if there is V 1 and this is the velocity\nV 1 this is the cross sectional area A 1,\nthis is the velocity V 2 and this is the cross\nsectional area A 2 and for incompressible\nfluid because rho is equal on both side we\ncan get it cancelled and we can simply write\nA 1 V 1 is equal to A 2 V 2. So, this is the\ncontinuity equation in one dimension.\n(Refer Slide Time 21:05)\nNow, when there is a variation of velocity\nacross the cross section of the conduit for\nan incompressible fluid discharge like this,\nyou see. So, if these velocity, you see, this\nis the velocity component, this is V, and\nthis is cross sectional area 1 this is cross\nsectional area 2 and if this is the profile,\nwe can simply write, still the equation of\ncontinuity will hold but what we do instead\nbecause the velocity is varying across the\ncross section, so, instead of writing V 1\nA1 what we do is we integrate the velocity\nwith area for the entire surface and do it\non the same the other side as well. So, let\nus save this is this side A 1 and this is\nthe other side A 2, no change just that we\nhave to use a differential or an integral\nform here.\n(Refer Slide Time 22:11)\nSo, we are going to see a practice problem.\nNow, this figure we are going to show, shows\na pipe network with junction nodes at A, this\nis junction node B, C, D, E and F. The numerals\nin the figure like this 100, 30, indicates\nthe discharges at the node or in the pipes\nas the case is and the arrows indicate the\ndirection of the flows. So, this let me just\nerase this one now. So, you see, this means\nthat the flow is in this direction and this\nmeans this flows in this direction but many\nof like here it is already told that the flow\nis in this direction.\nBut other places we have to calculate. So,\nthe question is by continuity equation determine\nthe missing discharge values and their direction\nin the pipes. So, we are lucky because they\nhave directly given us the discharge value\nand that is what we have to preserve, A 1\nV 1 is discharge in the pipes AB which is\nunknown so question mark BC, CD and EF actually\nwe can calculate BF, BE as well BE yeah all\nthe 5.\n(Refer Slide Time 23:49)\nSo, we go to the solutions. So, by the continuity\ncriterion, this is quite important, the flow\nentering into a node must be equal to the\nflow going out of the node as the continuation\nof continuity says, thus, by considering the\nflow. So, what we do is we consider flow in\nto the node as positive and flow out of node\nas negative. So, at point, so, there is a\npoint here and whatever goes in for example,\nx goes in x / 3 and 2x / 3, whatever goes\nin will go out because of the equation of\ncontinuity. Therefore, what this implies is\nit that the algebraic sum of the discharges\nat a node is 0, this is quite important. So,\nthis is the fundamental that we calculate\nthus at node A. So, let us go back and see,\nif we assume, this is we called Q A B. So,\n100 is coming in and 70 is going out and QAB\nalso going out. If we consider this node here,\nlet me just erase this. This node A 70 was\nhere and we assume QAB here.\nSo, this will be 0. So, this is reflected\nby the equation here, 100 - 70 - Q AB is equal\nto 0. So, what we get simply using this equation,\nQ AB is 30 and is from A to B, very simple.\nSo, the first we, now we go to node D, this\nis node D. So, if we calculate, if we see,\nso 50 is also coming in this direction, 70\nis also coming into this direction and there\nshould be something here that is called Q\nDC, I think. So, 70 + 50 - Q DC is equal to\n0. Therefore, we get Q DC is equal to 120\nand it is from D to C.\nSimilarly, at node C, you go to node C. Let,\nme erase this. This is node C, this we have\nalready calculated, right, this was in this\ndirection 120, this we already know and this\nfor example, we need to calculate QCB or QBC\nwhatever it is there. So, this is known, this\nis known and this is unknown, right. So, this\nis 120 going in, 80 was going out and Q CV\nwas also going out therefore, we get Q CB\nis equal to 40 and it is from C to B.\nNow going to the node B, node B, so, now,\nthis is known, this is known, this is known,\nthis is known and we need to calculate this\none. So, all most of the things are known\nfor node B because node B will have incoming\nfrom here that we have already calculated.\nThis we just calculated. This we know from\nbefore and this is already given as 20. So,\nfor node B; 30 + 40 - 30 - Q BE - 20 and this\nis going to give Q BE, as 20 but direction\nis from B to E. Let, me just erase all the\nink.\nAnd finally at node E, if we go back again\nto node E, right, this is we know, this is\nwe know, now, this is also we know from our\nlast calculation. This is the one that we\nneed to calculate now, so only one unknown\nis there. So, 80 + 20 - QF - 90 is equal to\n0\n(Refer Slide Time 29:01)\nAnd this gives us Q EF is equal to 10 and\nQ EF is from E to F. So, at node F we need\nto calculate our final quantity QF then see\nthat is simply discharged out of node F. So,\nwe know this, we know this, 10 was coming\nhere, so, 20 + 10 and that will be simply\n30. So, simple application of continuity equation\nthat comes 30. Now, the final distributions\nof the discharges are in as follows: I will\njust take you, 100 goes in 30 is distributed,\n100 goes in here, 30 distributed here, 70\ncomes here.\nNow, 50 + 70 120 will go here and at node\nC, 80 is going in this direction, 40 is going\nin this direction. At node B, 30 which is\ncoming here will go there, 40 that is going,\ncoming here it is distributed 20 this side,\n20 this side. At node E, 80 is coming in this\ndirection and 10 is going in this direction.\nHowever, we were also getting 20 from this\ndirection therefore, resulting will be 90.\nSo, at node F, what is happening is, we get\n20 from this side, 10 from this side and this\ntotal 30 is going from this side.\nSo, every place the equation of continuity\nis satisfied. So, this is one of the simplest\nmost problem that you can see about the equation\nof continuity. Normally, this could also happen\nin place of the velocities, you know, only\nthe velocity can give in the areas of these\npipes could be different, but the procedure\nwill remain the same you have to calculate\nA 1, V 1, A 2, V 2 and so on and come and\nequate the discharges as we did here in the\nsimplest example. So this is for today. I\nam going to see you again in the next class.\nThank you so much.",
    "video_6": "Welcome back to the next lecture. So, last\nlecture we finished with the equation of continuity\nand solving a very simple problem for a pipe\nflow where the discharges were given. So,\nwe have seen it the equation of continuity\nA 1 V 1 = A 2 V 2.\nSo, now we need to also see it in a differential\nform, this is the most famous form of the\ncontinuity equation. So, in Cartesian coordinates\nthe equation of continuity is written as del\nrho/del t + del rho u / del x + del rho v\n/ del y + delta rho w / del z these are the\nconvective terms. For incompressible flow\nthis the density does not changes with time\nand hence the above equation is simplified\nas and the rho can come out it does not change\neither with respect to x or I mean, the coordinate\nand time. Therefore, this can simply be written\nas, so, this will go to 0, Rho will come out,\nso, it will become rho del u del x + rho del\nv / del y + rho del w / del z is equal to\n0 and if rho is not equal 0 it can be cancelled\nfrom process. So, this is the continuity equation\nin the differential form.\nNow, talk about rotational and irrotational\naction. If we consider, a rectangular fluid\nelement of side dx and dy, as in this figure\nyou see, this is point A, this is point B,\nhere, point A, point B, and this is dx, this\nis the distance, I mean, this is the distance\nof, you know, the side, dx and this is the\ndy. This is a fluid particle. Under the action\nof velocities, for example, here there is\na velocity A, at A it is u and at in the in\nthe x direction and V in the y direction.\nSo, on the side dx, it is u and this dy its\nv. So, this, you know, fluid element can undergo\na rotation and a rotation or a deformation\nright now, I mean, we call it deformation\nas we can see here. So, this will undergo\nsome rotation, you know and so, at point B\nthe velocities if we assume, in this direction\nit is changing. So, u is changing in this\ndirection as del u / del y into dy and similarly,\nwhile coming from here this velocity is changing\nin x direction as del v del x dx.\nTherefore, the u and v corresponding, u and\nv velocities here, will be u + del u del y\ndy and v velocity will be v + del v del x\ndx. So, this fluid particle will rotate as\nit appears in the figure 8.b and this distance,\nthis distance is going to be del v del x dx\ninto dt, if we are considering the rotation\nand time dt. Similarly, this will be coming\nfrom here multiplied by dt and if this angle\nis gamma 1 and this is gamma 2.\nGamma1 here, is angular velocity of element\nAB which is equal to del v del x. Gamma 2\nis angular velocity of element ad, that is,\ndel u del y. We can go back to this slide\nhere, you see, del v del x and this is del\nu del y as we have written. Considering the\nanti clockwise rotation as positive, the average\nof the angular velocities of the 2 mutually\nperpendicular elements is defined as rate\nof rotation.\nSo, this example, we took to tell you about\nwhat actually is the rate of rotation. Thus,\nthe rotation about z axis can be given as\nhalf into del v x del v / del x - del u / del\ny, because this is going to rotate, you see,\nthe rotation this direction and because of\nthis it is in this direction and because of\nthis it is in this direction. So, they are\nopposite to each other. That is why this negative\nsign so, it is rotation in z axis is half\nof del v del x - del u del y.\nThus, for a 3 dimensional fluid element 3\nrotational components, as given following\nare possible, about z axis the rotation is\ngiven as half del v del x - del u del y. Similarly,\nabout y axis, its rotation is given as omega\ny it is half del u del z – w del w del x\nand repeating the same exercise in X rotation\nabout x axis, it is given as half del w del\ny - del v del z. So, these are the 3 components\nof rotation.\nFluid motion, with one or more of the terms\nomega z, omega y or omega x. So, this is not\nomega z, this is omega x. If these terms are\nnot 0, this motion where these omegas at least\none of them is not 0 is called rotational\nmotion. So, the condition is omega z slash\nomega y slash omega x should not be equal\nto 0, if at least one of them is not equal\nto 0 it is called rotational motion. So, twice\nthe value of these omegas about any axis is\ncalled the vorticity along that axis.\nYou must have heard the term vorticity. Thus,\nthe equation for vorticity along z axis is\n2 omega z is equal to. So, this is if you\nremember, the omega z was half times this\nthing. So, this is the vorticity along. So,\na flow now is said to be irrotational if all\ncomponents of rotational is 0. So, that means,\nomega x is equal to omega y is equal to omega\nz is equal to 0. This is the definition of\nirrotational flow and this is what is, let,\nme write it more properly. Omega x is equal\nto omega y is equal to omega z is equal to\n0.\nThis is called irrotational flow. This is\nwhat we assume, the water flow and in most\nof our hydraulic engineering based application\nwe assume, the water is irrotational. The\nflow in the water is irrotational that is\nwhy this concept is quite important. You already\nknow this because you have already done the\nfluid mechanics course. So, exactly what I\nhave written.\nNow, we will see, a practice problem, for\nthe following flows, determine the components\nof rotation about various axes. So, we have\nbeen given u is equal to x y cube z, V is\nequal to - y square z square, w is yz square\n- y cube z square / 2. So, we already know\nthe formulas. So, the components of rotation\nabout various axes our omega z, you see here,\nis given by this is a standard formula that\nwe have seen.\nSo, what we need to do is del v del x. So,\ndel v is not a function of x. So, del v del\nx will be 0 here, as it is written, or let\nme just, you know, take an eraser it is, so,\nthis one. So, this is going to be so, I will\nbring back the pen, so, this will be 0 now\ndel u / del y. So, from here, del u / del\ny is going to be 3 x y square z and this is\nwhat has been written here, and this 0 has\nbeen written here. So, therefore, which implies\nomega z is written as - 3 / 2x y square z.\nThis is one of the component. So, I am erasing\nall the ink again.\nSo, we can concentrate on the other, omega\nx is by definition. So, again this is definition,\nwe need to calculate del w del y and del v\ndel z. So, let is look at w here , there is\na y component. So, del w del y. So, del w\ndel y can be written as z square - 3y square\nz square / 2 and this is here. See here, now,\nwe also need to know what del v del z is.\nSo, del v / del z, from here, is going to\nbe minus 2 y square z, and this has been put\nwith a minus sign here, so, this becomes plus\nwhen coming here.\nSo, I will erase ink, so, that you are able\nto follow. So, this is the. And similarly,\nomega y will be half, this again is a definition.\nNow, del u del z, so, it will be x y cube\nand del w del x. So, there is no x here. So,\ndel w del x will be is equal to 0 and this\nis has been shown here, this has been shown\nhere. So, I will erase all these ink here.\nSo, we have calculated wz, wx and wy and this\ngives us our 3 rotational components.\nNow, stream function, what actually is a stream\nfunction? So, in a 2d flow or a 2 dimensional\nflow, this type of flow considers two stream\nlines S1 and S2. The flow rate per unit depth\nof an incompressible fluid across two stream\nlines is constant and independent of the path.\nSo, in a 2 dimensional flow we consider two\nstream lines S1and S2. The flow rate of an\nincompressible fluid, for example, water across\nthe 2 stream line is constant and is independent\nof the path. Path a or path b from A to B\nin figure 9.\nSo, this is the figure, this is one stream\nline, this is two stream line. So, you see,\nthis is A, this is B and this is path a, this\none going to B and this is path b going away\nfrom this to this .\nSo, based on that a stream function psi is\nso defined that it is constant along the stream\nline and the difference of these stream line\nfor the 2 streamline is equal to the flow\nrate between them. This is an important definition\nfor we will have a lecture on viscous fluid\nflow where we will be deriving everything\nfrom scratch the equation of continuity to\nNavier Stokes equation along with this stream\nlines, we are going to see. There we will\nprove this, but for now, you have as studied\nin your fluid mechanics class, the stream\nfunction phi is defined so that this stream\nfunction is constant along the stream line\nand the difference of the phi s that the stream\nfunction for the 2 stream lines A and B is\nequal to the flow rate between them. Thus,\nphi A - phi B is equal to flow rate between\nS 1 and S 2. The flow from left to right is\ntaken as positive, in the sign convention.\nSo, this is what we assumed, that if the flow\nis from left to right it is positive. The\nvelocity is u and v in x and s directions\nare given by, this is important. So, if there\nis a stream function psi. So, u is given by\ndel psi / del y and v is given as del psi\n/ del x. This is the most important formula\nthat actually you must be remembering.\nSo, the stream function psi is defined as\nabove for 2 dimensional flows only. It cannot\nbe defined for the 3 dimensional, for an irrotational\nflow del v / del x - del u / del y is equal\nto 0. This is we know from irrotational flow,\ncorrect. Therefore, if we substitute v as,\nwhat we saw v was you go back and see v was\n- del psi / \ndel x. And u was del psi / del y. Now, put\nv as this and u as this you are going to get\n- del square psi / del x square - del square\npsi / del y square is equal to 0 and this\nis the Laplace equation.\nSo, we can proceed to the next slide, there\nis something called a potential function.\nSo, in an irrotational flow the velocity can\nbe written as, gradient of scalar function\nphi called the velocity potential that is\nfor an irrotational flow. Phi is velocity\npotential therefore, u in terms of velocity\npotential is written as del phi / del x, v\nis written as del phi / del y and w is written\nas del phi / del z.\nConsidering, the equation of continuity for\nan incompressible fluid, what was the equation\nof continuity? If you recall del u / del x\n+ del v / del y + del w / del z is equal to\n0, for incompressible, correct. This we have\nalready written, alright and if we substitute\nthese u v and w here, what are we going to\nget? del square phi is equal to del square\nphi / del x square + delta square phi / del\ny square + del y / del z square and this is\nagain tell me \nLaplace equation, that is good.\nSo, we can proceed now. As I said, the velocity\npotential satisfies the Laplace equation for\nan incompressible fluid and an irrotational\nflow. Conversely, any function phi which satisfies\nthe Laplace equation is a possible irrotational\nfluid flow case. So, this concept will be\nused in numericals that you are going to solve.\nSo, some any function phi which satisfies\nthe Laplace equation is a possible irrotational\nfluid flow case. Lines of constant phi velocity\npotential are called equipotential lines.\nThis is again an important concept, and it\ncan be shown that these lines will form orthogonal\ngrids with phi is equal to constant lines.\nThis fact is used in construction of the flow\nnets for fluid flow analysis that we can talk\nabout it more later. There are people can\nalso, I mean, there are some authors which\nalso define instead of + u is equal to del\nphi / del x they simply prefer u is equal\nto – del phi del x. It depends on upon lot\nof convention but any of these formulas is\ncorrect. I would ask you to stick with this\nequation u is equal to del phi / del x.\nNow, the relationship between phi and psi\nfor 2 dimensional flow. So, as we have seen\nthis phi exist for an irrotational flow only.\nThen u is equal to del phi / del x velocity\npotential is equal to del psi / del y. And\nsimilarly, v given as, this is potential function\ndel phi / del y and this is = streamlines\nis - del psi / del x that we have seen before\nand it is this. So, psi is constant along\nthe stream line and phi is constant along\nequipotential line which is normal to the\nstreamlines.\nBy continuity equation what we can write is\ndel phi, del square phi / del x square + delta\nsquare phi / del y square is equal to 0 for\n2d case. By irrotational flow condition we\ncan write del square psi / del x square +\ndel square psi / del y square is equal to\n0 this is an important, you see, both satisfying\nthe Laplace equation for irrotational flow\ncondition for continuity equation.\nNow, we will see a practice problem. So there\nis a velocity potential for 2 dimensional\nflow, which is given by phi is equal to x\nsquare - y square + 3 x y. First, we have\nto calculate the stream function, and then\nwe have to calculate the flow rate between\nthe streamlines passing through the points\n1, 1 and 1, 2. So, this question will actually\nclarify all your practical, if you have any\ndoubt but it is very simple to calculate.\nSo, we can look at the solution. So phi, first\nwe write what is given to us, so, we have\nwritten phi = x square - y square + 3 x y.\nSo, we are going to use one of the equations,\nu can be written as, del phi / del x this\nwe know and u can also be written as del psi\n/ del y correct. So, from psi we find del\nphi / del x is equal to this will be 2 x.\nThis will become, I mean, when we start calculating\nthis will become - 0 + 3 y or 2 x + 3 y, but\nthis del phi / del x or u is also equal to\ndel psi / del y. So, we can simply integrate\nthis to obtain psi as it is. So, I will remove\nthis.\nSo, psi can be integrated to 2 x y + 3 / 2y\nsquare very simple integration with respect\nto y, plus not a constant but anything that\nis a function of x . Similarly, v is given\nas del phi / del y. So, we should calculate\nthis. So, I will do this then I will remove\ndel phi / del y is equal to see, x will become\n0, del in terms, because there is no y term\nhere. So, this will be 0 - 2 y + 3 x y will\ngive 3 x.\nThis will become - 2 y + 3 x and this is also\nequal to - del psi / del x according to the\ndefinition, and you integrate this equation\nand when you integrate this equation, you\nwill be able to solve this for again a psi.\nSo, first let me remove the ink \nand from one, I mean, this is. So, this is\none of the ways that you can solve and then\nequate, but here what we have done is because\npsi we already have. So we have calculated\nfrom this equation del psi / del x and this\ncame - 2 y - f dash x.\nAnd then in the end we have substituted it\nwith this. Thus, f dash x is equal to, so\nsee, let me just go back. So, from the first\nequation we have calculated psi , which was\na function of x. Using this equation we have\ncalculated del psi / del x we got it - 2 y\n- f dash x and we have substituted this to\nthis equation. Here, what happened was - 2\ny + 3 x was equal to - 2 y - f dash x. Therefore,\nf dash x became - 3 x. There are 2 different\nways the other way was also fine. So, f x,\nf x is because we obtain f dash x.\nSo, f x is - 3 / 2 x square. Therefore, the\nrequired stream function will be we substitute\nf of x from here, into 1 to obtain 2 x y +\n3 / 2 y square - 3 / 2 x square. So, it can\nbe written as 2 x y - 3 / 2 x square - y square\nsame as this. So, now we are given the point.\nThe second question was we have to we have\ncalculated the stream function, now, the flow\nrate between the stream lines passing through\nthe points 1, 1 and 1, 2.\nSo, at point 1, 1 psi 1 will be just substituting\nthe value of 1 comma 1 will be 2 units, at\npoint 1 comma 2 the psi 2 is going to be substituting\n1 comma 2 in the psi that we have obtained\ngives us 8.5 units and the flow rate between\nthe streamlines passing 1 will be the difference\nof this and this, and this is going to give\nus 6.5 units. So, I think with this we have\nconcluded the fluid kinematics part and it\nis almost time. So, I think we will start\nwith elementary fluid dynamics that is Bernoulli’s\nequation in our next class. And until then,\ngoodbye. See you next class. Bye bye.",
    "video_7": "Welcome back in this lecture we are going\nto start elementary fluid dynamics or more\ncommonly Bernoulli,s equation. So, we are\ngoing to cover some basic derivation in this\nregard and then we proceed further to some\nof the solved examples.\nSo, we are going to see the Bernoulli along\na stream line. So, if you remember this equation\nwe had got from the in the last weeks lecture\nthat is on fluid statics. So, if you I am\njust going to, you know, draw a stream line\nthis is i direction, this is j direction and\nthis is k direction, it is better to take\naway all the ink I should and this is the\ns direction is the streamline, I mean, the\ndirection of the streamline and this is normal\nto the stream line.\nSo, we have to separate the acceleration due\nto gravity and coordinate axis here can be\nin any orientation. This is quite important\nto understand, k is vertical, s is in the\ndirection of the flow and is normal to the\nflow that is our standard assumption that\nwe have been taking. So, this equation when\nwe start writing down, you know, in the component\nform, so, delta p in the s direction will\nbe – del p / del s is equal to rho into\nacceleration and this g, then that we have\nto take the component of g in the direction\nof s and that can be written as rho g dz / ds.\nSo, that is the component of g in s direction.\nSo, we have to note that there is no shear\nforces there the flow must be frictionless.\nThis is also a steady state so, there is no\nchange in p with respect to time, p is pressure.\nSo, the equation that we have obtained is\n- del p / del s is equal to rho a s + gamma\ndz / ds from here. So, rho g is gamma, going\nback to the slide again. So, this is what\nwe have got - delta p / delta s is equal to\nrho a s + gamma dz / ds. So, can we eliminate\nthis partial derivative? Yes. So, a s is actually\nthe total derivative dv / dt and this can\nbe written as del V / del s multiplied by\nds / dt and this can be written as V del v\ndel s or del s del v del s into V.\nAnd this is obtained through this way of doing\nthis, you know, this differentiation is called\nthe chain rule, write acceleration as a derivative\nwith respect to s. So, the total change in\npressure can be written as dp is delta p / delta\ns into d s + delta p / delta n into d n. So,\nn is constant along the stream line so, d\nn = 0. Therefore, this term goes so, dp / ds\ncan be written as del p / del s, you see.\nNow, this is the total and this is the partial\nthat is why we are able to write this and\ndv / ds is written del v / del s.\nSo, this equation turns out to be – dp / ds\nbecause this is what we have proved from here,\nand dv / ds as del v / del s or the opposite.\nSo, we can write rho V dv / ds + gamma dz\n/ ds, a s is V del v del s and instead of\ndel v del s we can write dv ds. So, this is\nthe equation.\nNow, we have to use force is equal to mass\ninto acceleration along a streamline and integrate\nit. So, this is the equation that we have,\nso, what do we do? We integrate it, first\neliminate ds because it is common so, we can\nwrite dp + rho V dv, because dp will come\nthis side + gamma dz = 0 and if we integrate,\nthis will become dp. So, what we do is we\ndivide by, you know, rho so that this gamma\nbecomes z it will become dp / p + V dv + g\nintegral dz = 0.\nHere, the density is a function of pressure\nso, we have to keep it inside so, we write\nintegral dp / rho + V square / 2 and gz = constant.\nIf density is constant we can write p + half\nrho V square + gamma z = C p. So, what we\nhave done so, we have written the equation\nalong the stream line, applied force is equal\nto mass into acceleration along the streamline\nintegrated it and we have obtained Bernoulli’s\nequation along a stream line. This is one\nof the ways of the derivation.\nNow, the Bernoulli equation, the assumptions\nthat are needed for Bernoulli’s equation,\nwhat have we assumed, the flow was frictionless,\nthe flow was steady, the final equation that\nwe have derived we have assumed, constant\ndensity that means the flow was incompressible\nand we have done it for along a streamline.\nNow, can we eliminate the constant in Bernoulli’s\nequation? Yes, if we apply the Bernoulli’s\nequation at 2 points along a streamline, this\nis important so, the streamline should be\nthe same and if we apply this equation along\ntwo streamline, I mean, to 2 points along\na streamline the constant would be the same\nand therefore, it can be eliminated. Bernoulli\nequation does not include mechanical energy\nto thermal energy conversation, heat transfer\nor shaft work. So, this is some general information\nabout the Bernoulli equation that you might\nbe aware of from before.\nNow, the Bernoulli equation is a statement\nof conservation of mechanical energy. So,\nyou see, p / rho + g / gz + half V square.\nSo this is potential energy. So, let me take\nthe eraser. And this is let it this is kinetic\nenergy. I will take down the ink again. So,\nP / gamma + z + V square / 2g = C p, where\np / gamma is the pressure head, z is the elevation\nhead and V square / 2g is the velocity head.\nWe can also say that p / gamma + z is hydraulic\ngrade line HGL, very common concept in your\nfluid mechanics class, or piezometric head,\nwhereas, p / gamma + z + V square / 2g is\ncalled energy grade line EGL or total head.\nThis is something that you can be asked, you\nknow, by anyone whether you are giving, I\nmean, a gate exam or an interview sitting\nfor a company which works in hydraulics. So,\nyou must be remembering what hydraulic grade\nline is, what is energy grade line, what is\npiezometric head, what is total head.\nSo, now, proceeding forward first simple case,\nvery simple case, where V = 0. So, there is\npoint 1 and there is point 2, z direction\nis shown as above, you know, this is pressure\ndatum and this is elevation datum. Reservoir\nmeans V = 0. So, now, as I said this point\n1 has been put on surface and we can put point\n2 anywhere we have decided to put at this\nrandom point, point 2, point number 2.\nSo, we apply the Bernoulli equation between\nthese 2 points. So, in at in the reservoir\nthe velocity is 0. So, V square / 2g is going\nto be eliminated here. So, the between these\n2 points we can write p1 / gamma + z1 = p2\n/ gamma + z2, whatever it is going to be,\nwe also know that p1 is a gauge pressure and\nthis is a pressure datum atmospheric pressure,\nso, p1 will be 0. In our second case, so,\nwe can write z1 – z2 is = P2 / gamma.\nBecause elevation datum is here, so, 2 is\nanywhere. Here, we did not cross any stream\nline so this analysis is okay. If we keep\ncrossing the stream lines, then what happens\nis this equation is valid for 2 points on\nthe same stream lines; you cannot cross the\nstream lines. So, this analysis z1 - z2 = P\n2 / gamma. This is exactly the same analysis,\nwhich we have found using the statics lecture,\nif you remember from last week.\nSo, proceeding forward, so, we take another\nsimple case, where pressure is 0 or constant.\nWhat is an example of fluid experiencing a\nchange in elevation but remaining at a constant\npressure? It is an example is a free jet.\nWhat is a free jet? This can be taken as a\nfree jet, you fill a bottle with water or\nany fluid and make many holes, we saw similar\ntype of figure last week as well and you see\nthere are, you know, jets of, I mean, the\nfree jets, this one, this one, this one, this\none as well. I will delete that.\nSo, the equation, Bernoulli’s equation along\n1 streamline will be p1 / gamma + z1 + V 1\nsquare / 2g will be = at any point two same,\np 2 / gamma + z 2 + V 2 square / 2g. Because\nthis is atmospheric pressure at 0.1, we assume,\nthe 0.1 to be the free surface there. So,\npressure at 0.1 will be atmospheric therefore,\n0. Similarly, if we consider any point along\nthe stream line what is going to happen is\np 2 also exposed to atmosphere and that is\nalso 0.\nSo, we can write z 1 + V 1 square / 2g = z\n2 + V 2 square / 2g and therefore, the velocity\nat 0.2 will be V 1 square + 2g z 1 - z 2,\nwhere V 1 can be the velocity for velocity\nof the surface.\nSo, we talked about but if we talk about hydraulic\nand energy grade lines, the question is the\n2 centimeter diameter jet is 5 meter lower\nthan the surface of the reservoir, what is\nthe flow rate Q? Let us draw a figure like\nthis. So, this is the elevation datum here.\nSo, the equation Bernoulli equation is p / gamma\n+ z + V square / 2g = constant. We this is\nwe have to conserve the mechanical energy\nthat is the energy conservation. So, to make\nthis less cluttered will delete these annotations.\nSo, pressure datum is atmospheric pressure,\nvery simple, both at the out at here or here.\nSo, the jet solution, so, the question again\ncoming back to the question, the 2 centimeter\ndiameter jet is 5 meter lower than the surface\nof the reservoir. What is the flow rate Q?\nAgain drawing the same figure, this is the\nelevation datum, therefore, z 2 is 5 meter\nbelow that is what it says, 5 meter lower\nare the 2 points on the stream streamline?\nYes. So, we can write p 1 / gamma + V 1 square\n/ 2g + z 1 = so, these are the 2 points just\nthat if you are confused.\nSo, p 1 / gamma + V 1 square / 2g + z 1 = p\n2 / gamma + V 2 square / 2g + z 2, p 1 / gamma\nwill be 0, there is no velocity and, I mean,\nthis is at rest. So, the velocity is also\n0 and then the datum is also 0 because we\nhave set the elevation datum here. The pressure\nat 2 will also be 0 atmospheric pressure,\nnow, there will be a velocity and because\nthere is z 2, so V 2 will be under route 2g\n– z 2 and the discharge will be pi d 2 square\n/ 4, if d is the diameter 2 centimeter diameter\njet it says, under root 2g – z2 very simple\napplications, but it is important to, you\nknow, apply to these cases.\nSo, this is our 2 results, you know, v 2 and\nz 2 is – 5, so, you can obtain the, it will\nbe approximately 10 meters per second. For\nexample, if you assume g as, if you take 10\nmeters per second square, v 2 will be under\nroot 2 into – 5, so, that means, +5 into\n10. So, v will come out to be 10 meters per\nsecond.\nSo, one of the other applications of Bernoulli\nequation is the stagnation tube. What happens\nwhen the water starts flowing in the channel?\nFor example, this and so, the equation along\nthe stream line by Bernoulli equation will\nbe can be given as p / gamma + z + V square\n/ 2g = constant. Here, the orientation of\nthe tube is like this, but does the orientation\nof the tube matter? Yes, because it can either\nlower up, I mean, it can change the different\nvalue of z so, yes. How does high does the\nwater rise in this stagnation tube that we\nhave to calculate. How do we choose the points\non this timeline, another important question\nthat we will solve?\nSo, we assume, points 1a, 2a,1b and 2b like\nthis, this point, this point, this point and\nthis point. The equation, Bernoulli equation\nwill be the same p / gamma + z + V square\n/ 2g = constant. So, if you go from 1a to\n2a, velocity will be a function of pressure,\nit is the same stream line; 1a is going to\n1a to 2a, if you go from 1b to 2a it crosses\nperpendicular stream lines. If you go from\n1a to 2b, it does not cross the stream lines,\ngoing from 1a to 2a does not cross the stream\nline.\nIn all cases, what we do not know is p1. So,\nthe equation, Bernoulli equation p 1 / gamma\n+ z 1 + V 1 square / 2g is constant. So, p\n1 / gamma + z 1 is going to be, we can set\nit as 0 at 0.1 and because this is exposed\nto atmosphere we can assume to be 0 and because\nthis has reached at the top what happens is,\nthere will be no velocity because the water\nwill have high rise until the maximum, you\nknow, that it can and there the velocity will\nbe 0.\nSo, we can simply write, V 1 square / 2 g,\nso, the velocity that is there will be = 2g\nz 2 or v 1 is 2g z 2. So, this is the velocity\nor if we know the velocity there we can estimate\nz 2 that is how the water is going to rise\nin the stagnation tube.\nNow, there is another thing pitot tube, which\nis used to measure the flow velocities in\nan aero plane as well. So, this is how a pitot\ntube looks like. It is used to measure air\nspeed on aero planes. It is very old technique\nbut still very successfully this is used for\nmeasuring the air speed on an airplane. It\ncan connect differential pressure transducers\nto measure the V square / 2g because Bernoulli\nequation has V square / 2g. So, what it does\nis measures V square / 2g and therefore tells\nthe airspeed.\nIt can be used to measure the flow of water\nin pipelines also pitot tube. So, this is\nsomething like this, it looks something like\nthis, in an aero plane, so this is fixed in\nthe aeroplane. So, this is, it shows this\nhow many knots are there, I mean, the typical\npanel of the aero plane speed. An important\nthing to note is, this is a point measurement\nbecause Bernoulli principle is applied at\ndifferent points along a stream line this\nis important to note.\nSo, pitot tube, so, there is a velocity V,\nthere is 0.1 here and 0.2 here. So, connect\n2 ports to a differential pressure transducers.\nMake sure that the pitot tube is completely\nfilled with the fluid that is being measured.\nSolve for velocity as a function of pressure\ndifference. This is stagnation pressure tap,\nthis is static pressure tap. So, what it does\nis it measures pressure at 0.1 at 0.2. And\nso, the Bernoulli equation says p 1 / gamma\n+ z 1 + V 1 square / 2g is constant. So, here,\nz 1 is, you know, is 0 at 0.1.\nWe assume, that is the datum and because it\nis a stagnation point, the velocity at 1 will\nalso be = 0. Because this is also at the point\n2 is also here, where datum is 0, that z 2\nis also = 0. So, V 1 is 0 and z 1 = z 2 that\nis why we have done this. So, V that is measured\nhere is a difference of pressure and is equal\nto V is equal to using this equation we get\nthis and p 1 and p 2 are measured using this\npressure transducers. So, this \nis how the pitot tube works or functions.\nSo, there, I mean, there are some relaxed\nassumptions for Bernoulli equation, I mean,\nideally but Bernoulli equation should be applied\nfor the assumptions that we had discussed\na couple of slides ago. But there could be\nsome relaxed assumptions for Bernoulli equation.\nFor example, frictionless, that the velocity\nis not influenced by viscosity, so, there\nis if the flow is not frictionless there will\nbe some energy loss accelerating flow.\nFor example, at short distances there we can\napply a steady flow or we can also use gradually\nvarying flow. Constant density incompressible,\nso, if we have very small changes in density\nthen also we can apply Bernoullis equation,\nit will not be the exact, but approximately\nequal and we have to use it along a stream\nline and but this cannot be relaxed, we cannot\ncross a stream line because the constant C\nwill change and therefore, Bernoullis equation\nwill no longer be valid.\nSo, another concept is Bernoulli’s equation\nnormal to the stream lines. We have seen along\nthe streamline, now the other is normal to\nthe stream line. So, we have seen this in\nthe previous, you know, when we are dealing\nwith the Bernoulli’s equation along the\nstream line. So, similarly, we can write minus\nthe force equation we can write, - delta p\n/ delta n + rho a n + rho g dz dn. Here, a\nn is V square / R, where, R is the local radius\nof curvature, n is towards the center of the\nradius of curvature and this is equal to 0,\ns is constant along the stream line.\nSo, therefore, proceeding in a similar way,\nwe obtain dp = del p del s into ds + delta\np delta n into dn, you remember, we had the\nsame along the stream line ds = 0 because\nand we can write dp dn = del p del n. So,\nwhat happens is we get - dp dn = rho V square\n/ R + rho g dz dn because we can write delta\np delta n is equal to and we obtained this\nfrom this, so, this equation becomes this,\nthe same procedure, no changes whatsoever.\nSo, this is the equation we are not going\ninto too much detail about this, but this\nis how you can have the Bernoulli equation\nnormal to the streamlined. So, you see when\nyou integrate this, this will have a different\nconsequence. So, now the Bernoulli’s equation\napplications; 1 is stagnation tube that you\nhave already seen, the other was pitot tube\nwhich we discussed, the free jets equation\nwe have seen.\nWe have not seen orifice, but orifice is one\nof the other areas where Bernoulli’s equation\nis there. Venturi meter, the Bernoulli’s\nequation is applied across sluice gate and\nsharp crested weir, this is how a Venturi\nmeter looks like, this is how a sluice gate.\nSo, these actually are all, you know, practical\nplaces where Bernoulli’s equation can be\napplied. So, I will take this one and these\nare applicable to the contracting streamlines\naccelerating flow.\nOne of the examples as I said, we had not\nseen was venturi meter, how would you find\nthe flow Q given the pressure drop between\npoint 1 and 2 and the diameter of the 2 section?\nYou may assume the head loss is negligible.\nDraw the EGL and the HGL over the contracting\nsection of the venturi metre? So, this is\nthe venturi meter, the water will rise depending\nupon the pressure. How many unknowns what\nequations are you going to use? Those are\nthe questions.\nSo, the first thing that we can do is, we\napply at points at 2 points we apply the Bernoulli’s\nequation. So, we take the pressure p 1 p 2\non one side z 1 = z 2, so, that will be p\n1 / gamma - p 2 / gamma = V 2 square / 2g\n- V 1 square / 2g. As you see the point 1\nand 2 the datum is same that is why we were\nable to cancel this 1 out and Q = velocity\ninto area V 1 A 1 = V 2 A 2. So, V 1 pi d\n1 square / 4 = V 2 pi d 2 square / 4. So,\nV 1 d 1 square = V 2 d 2 square just continuing\nwith this thing, so, V 1 = V 2 d 2 square\n/ d 1 square.\nNormally, we know d 1 and d 2. So, there is\na relationship obtained between V1 and V2.\nSo, putting V1 in terms of V2, so, we can\ninstead of V 1 obtained from here, we can\nput here and therefore, we can get this equation\nhere, you know. Therefore, on writing V 2\nwe can get 2g p 1 - p 2 gamma 1 - d 2 / d\n1 to the power 4 and Q simply we multiply\nthis with V 1 A 1.\nWe have this account this term Cd, that is,\nfor, you know, practical problems and I know\npractical problems. There is a coefficient\nthat you determine in experiments but anyways\nthis is the theoretically this is the main\nmethod p 1 and p 2 you can obtain from how\nmuch the pressure water has risen into the.\nSo, this is the question, water flows up a\ntapered pipe as shown in figure below. Find\nthe magnitude and direction of the deflection\nh of the differential mercury manometer comprising\nto a discharge of 120 liters per second. The\nfriction in the pipe can be completely neglected.\nI think we should stop the class for today\nnow, and resume our next class by solving\nthis practice problem. Thank you so much.\nSee you in the next class.",
    "video_8": "Welcome back, we are going to start this lecture\nby solving the practice problem, which where\nwe ended our last lecture.\nSo, the problem goes like this, the water\nflows up a tapered pipe as shown in the figure\nbelow. Find the magnitude and direction of\nthe deflection h of the differential mercury\nmanometer corresponding to a discharge of\n120 liters per second. The friction in the\npipe can be completely neglected. The reason\nof neglecting the friction completely is,\nso that, we are able to apply, you know what,\nBernoulli’s equation.\nSo, if we say that S be the relative density\nof mercury, so, if we have relative density\nof mercury S, we can relate all the densities\nto water using this relative density. So,\nfor the manometer here, considering the elevation\nthis section as the datum, we can write the,\nyou know, we can write the Bernoulli equation\nas p 1 / gamma + x + h here + h is = p 2 / gamma\n+ .8, what is .8, this is .8 + x + S into\nh, because this is the mercury.\nThis is from fluid statics, what we are doing\nis, we are equating the pressures here. So,\np 1 / gamma + x you see, this here start from\nhere we go down x + we go h down again, so,\nthis is this starting at 1. Now, that will\nbe equal to if we are able to find p 2 so,\nthe p 2 / gamma + 0.8 that is because this\nis 80 centimeters plus x plus because this\nis pressure but the mercury is there no water\nso, instead of h we write Sh and this is how\nwe get this equation.\nSo, we can write p 1 / gamma - p 2 / gamma\n- .8 because x x gets cancelled plus = S - 1\ninto h. So, this will become S is 13.6 that\nbecomes 12.6 into h.\nSo, by continuity criterion Q is going to\nbe you see, pi / 4 area A 1 V 1. So, V 1 we\nknow, so, V 1 is the velocity at this section,\narea because this is 30 centimeters in diameter.\nSo, pi d square / 4 into V 1 is q 1, so, d\n1 pi / 4 into V 2. So, here, this is A 2,\nand this is V 2, this is A 1, this is V 1,\nso, V 1 from this method because Q is already\ngiven. What is the Q already given? 120 liters\nper second so, we can find V 1 and therefore,\nwe also can find out V 2.\nNow, by Bernoulli equation for points 1 and\n2, p 1 / gamma + V 1 square / 2g + z 1 is\nequal to P 2 / gamma + V 2 square / 2g + z\n2. So, p 1 / gamma - p 2 / gamma + 0 - 0.8\nif you calculate z 1 and z 2 is equal to V\n2 square - V 1 square / 2g, this is going\nto come to 2.034. So, p 1 - p 2 / gamma - 0.8\nis also equal to 12.6 h and that is also equal\nto 2.2034. Therefore, h can be found out as\n2.2034 divided by 12.6 and that gives h is\nequal to 17.5 centimeters.\nSo, we have used continuity equation, we have\nused Bernoulli equation, we have also used\nfluid statics and using all those 3 we have\nfound out the value of h the value of h here.\nSo, this completes our Bernoulli equation\nhowever, we are going to continue with the\nfinal topic of the basics of fluid mechanics\nthat is called fluid dynamics. So, we have\nread about fluid statics, we have read about\nelementary fluid dynamics that is Bernoulli\nequation,we have read about fluid can kinematics,\nwe have read about properties of fluid and\nthis we are going to see so that, we are able\nto solve the, you know, momentum equations\nfor example, in the fluid flow. This, I mean,\nthese all topics are very briefly taught,\nbecause you have already done in a lot of\ndetail in your fluid mechanics second year\ncourse.\nSo, to start fluid dynamics, one of the most\nimportant theorems that generally is not taught\nin fluid mechanics is Reynolds transport theorem.\nSo, what we are going to do, we are going\nto derive this Reynolds transport theorem\nin a little bit more detail. So, all physical\nlaws are stated in terms of various physical\nparameters. So, if B represents any of these,\nthese parameters can be velocity, acceleration,\nmass, temperature, momentum, anything etc.\nSo, what it says is, let B represent any of\nthese fluid parameter capital ‘B’ and\nsmall ‘b’ represent the amount of that\nparameter per unit mass, that is, B is equal\nto m into b, where m is the mass of the portion\nof the fluid of interest, b will be 1 if B\nis equal to m. So, B is the amount of that\nparameter per unit mass. The parameter B,\ncapital B is termed as extensive property\nand the parameters b is termed as intensive\nproperty.\nBecause it is the parameter per unit mass,\nthe value of B is directly proportional to\nthe amount of mass being considered. Whereas,\nthe value of a b is independent of the amount\nof mass because by definition, it is the amount\nof the parameter per unit mass b.\nThe amount of an extensive property that the\nsystem possesses at a given instant B, sys\nso, basis is the amount of the extensive property\nthat a system will have at any given instant.\nAnd how that can be found out? It can be determined\nby adding up the amount associated with each\nfluid particle in the system, it is very simple.\nSo, B system can be calculated by summing\nup different B s, you know, capital B, capital\nB of each particle.\nIf, for an infinitesimal fluid particles of\nsize delta V and mass, rho delta V, this summation\ntakes the form of an integration over all\nthe particles in the system. So, if we start\nconsidering the fluid particles, small particle\nof size delta V and we tend the limit to 0,\nthis B sys will be integration of all the\nparticles of the system. So, B system is summation\nof bi rho i so, it is the summation of the\nmass. Correct.\nSo, this can be written as, rho b da, you\nsee, da or dV whatever, sorry, not da, its\nrho b dV. Because that is the B, B was a small\nm into small b. So, M is mass is rho into\ndv and multiplied by b this is the B system\nthis is the integration. I hope this is getting\nclear to you a little. This limits of the\nintegration cover the entire system. So, it\ncan be a moving volume as well. So, I am taking\nthis was not to, you know, give you difficult\nquestions in the exam or the test.\nBut this is to make you feel and appreciate\nhow these momentum equations that we are going\nto see in the fluid dynamics, how do they\nhave their origin. So, the Reynolds transport\ntheorem is very important in that aspect.\nSo, for doing that we have used the fact that\nthe amount of B in a fluid particle of mass\nrho delta V is given in terms of b by this\nis what we have assumed, in getting this delta\nb is equal to b rho delta V.\nSo, most of the laws governing fluid motion\ninvolve the time rate of change of an extensive\nproperty of a fluid system, the rate at which\nthe momentum of a system changes with time,\nfor example or the rate at which the mass\nof the system changes with time and so on.\nThus, we often encounter terms such as dB\nsys dt. So, not only B system is important\nwith that is the summation of so, B summation\nB sys was integral system rho b d V.\nSo, this is important but not only this, the\nderivative of this B sys this is also important\nbecause in many times we require that mass\nrate of change of mass or rate of change of\nmomentum. So, those things are required so,\nthat is why it is important to know these\nderivatives. To formulate the laws into a\ncontrol volume approach we must obtain an\nexpression for time rate of change of an extensive\nproperty within a control volume B cv and\nnot within a system.\nSo, we have to obtain the rate of change of\nextensive property in a control volume. And\nso until now what we have been doing is we\nhave written this extensive property in terms\nof a system, but to be able to obtain laws\nand formulate laws we should be writing that\nnot in terms of system, but in terms of control\nvolume,. So, the same thing we can write d\ndt of B cv is the differential of so, this\nfrom system goes to control volume, the same\nequation.\nSo, now we are, I mean, this is the prelude\nto but now we are going to derive Reynolds\ntransport theorem. We consider the control\nvolume to be that stationary volume within\nthe pipe or duct between section 1 and 2.\nSo, this figure have been taken from Munson,\nYoung and Okiishi, but yeah, so, you can refer\nto that book for the derivation of Reynolds\ntransport theorem as well. So, again repeating\nwe consider the control volume to be that\nstationary volume within the pipe or duct\nbetween section 1 and 2.\nThis is section one, this is section 2 or\nin this figure section 1 section 2. The system\nthat we consider is that fluid occupying the\ncontrol volume at some initial time t. So,\nthis blue line here, I mean, this line I will\njust take the laser pointer, so, this blue\nline is the fixed control surface at time\nt. However, after time delta t that is at\nt is equal to t + delta t our system boundary\nhas moved from here to here. So, we have divided\nit into 3 regions 1, 1 control volume 1, 2.\nSo, at short time later, at time t + del t\nthe system has moved slightly to the right,\nyou see, here, as we talked about, this has\nmoved from here to here. The fluid particles\nthat coincided with section 2 of the control\nsurface at time t, have moved distance. So,\nthe distance that has moved is V 2 into delta\nt, you see, here, the if this had a velocity\nV 2, this would have moved by V 2 delta t\nand this would have moved by V 1 delta t,\nwhere V 2 is the velocity of the fluid as\nit passes section 2. Similarly, the fluid\ninitially at section 1 has moved a distance\ndelta l 1 is equal to V 1 delta t where V\n1 is the fluid velocity at section 1. This\nI have already shown you in the previous figure.\nIf B is an extensive parameter of the system,\nthen the value of it for the system at time\nt is B system is equal to B control volume.\nSince the system and the fluid within the\ncontrol volume coincide at this time, its\nvalue at time t + delta t is, see, again I\nam repeating here the system and the fluid\nwithin the control volume both are coinciding\nat the beginning. So, B system is equal to\nB control volume that is true. Now, if we\nwant to find out the value of B system or\nB control volume at t + delta t\nso, B system at t + delta t will be B of control\nvolume t + delta t - B of 1 at t + delta t\n+ B 2 at t + delta t. So, now taking you back\nwhat actually is B 1 and B 2. So, you see,\nthis was 1, this was 2, because this has moved.\nNow, what earlier it was a part of B system.\nSo, this is simply we write, B cv t + delta\nt - this has moved, but this has already proceeded\nforward so, it has come into the system of\nB, B system.\nThus, the change in the amount of B in the\nsystem in time interval delta t divided by\nthis time interval is given by if B is an\nextensive parameter of the system, we can\nwrite delta B system by delta t, so, the change\nwill be equal to B system t + delta t - B\nsystem t divided by delta t. This is very\nstandard and we have already written B system\nat t and B system at t + delta t this is t\n+ delta t and that.\nSo, B system at t + delta t is coming from\nhere, - B system at t, this remains same.\nBy using the fact that at initial time t we\nhave B system t is equal to B control volume\nt. This is what we have seen in the last slide,\nwe can rearrange this. How? We see in the\nnext slide.\nSo, delta B system by del t became B cv t\n+ delta t - this 1 became this, and this is\nthe 1 that is here, in the next slide here,\n- B 1 t + delta t divided by delta t + B 2\nt + delta t divided by delta t. So, in the\nlimit t tends to 0 the first term on the right\nhand side of equation is seen to be the time\nrate of change of amount of B within the control\nvolume, so, this one. So, limit B cv t + delta\nt – B cv at t / delta t or it can be written\nas del B cv del t or integral of this, this\nwe have seen in the previous slide.\nThe third term on the right hand side of equation,\nso, the third term on the right hand side\nof the equation represents the rate at which\nextensive parameter B flows from control volume,\nacross the control surface. This can seen\nfrom the fact that amount of B within region\n2, the outflow region, is its amount per unit\nvolume rho b times the volume, that is, delta\nV 11 is equal to A2 into delta l 2.\nHence, B 2 at t + delta t can be written as,\nrho 2 b 2 multiplied by delta V 2 or in terms\nof it is called A 2 V 2 delta t. So, where\nb 2 and rho 2 are the constant values of b\nand rho across section 2. Thus, the rate at\nwhich this property flows from the control\nvolume B out is given by B out is given as\nlimit delta t tends to 0 B 2 at t + delta\nt divide by delta t or we can simply write\nrho 2 A2 V2 b2, correct simply the total mass\nthat is flowing out of the cross section area\n2.\nSimilarly, there will be an inflow of B into\nthe control volume in the section 1 during\nthe time interval delta t and that will be\nequal to rho1 b1 A1 V1 delta t.\nSo, now putting this all together where are\nb 1 and rho 1 are the constant values of b\nand rho cross section 1. Thus, the rate at\nwhich the property flows is given by rho1\nA1 V1 b1. If we combine all the equations\nwe see that the relationship between the time\nrate of change of B for the system and that\nfor the control volume is given by D Dt of\nB system is del del t of B cv + B out – B\nin or D b system Dt is equal to del B cv delta\nt + rho2 A2 V2 b2 - rho1 A1 V1 b1, this is\n1 equation that we obtain.\nNow, this equation above equation this is\na very simplified version of the Reynolds\ntransport theorem and this we have derived\nfrom the scratch the most basic thing.\nNow, the next step is we have to find this\nfor control volume and system for flow through\nan arbitrary fixed control volume, this is\narbitrary. Now, we will derive it for more\ngeneral conditions. So, this is the general\ncondition. So, this is in flow is happening\nin this there is this is outflow area and\nthis is the original the control volume. The\nfix control wall control surfaces the system\nboundary at time t is equal to t, and system\nboundary at time t + delta t, So, we consider\nan extensive fluid property B and seek to\ndetermine how the rate of change of B associated\nwith the system is related to the rate of\nchange of B within the control volume at any\ninstant. Same procedure but for the any arbitrary\nsurface.\nSo, in general, the control volume may contain\nmore than 1 inlet and 1 outlet. A typical\npipe system for example can contain several\ninlets and outlets as shown in this figure\nfor example, you know, can be more than that\nor even less than that so, we have to find\na general equations. So, so, this is the outflow\nportion of the control surface this 1 here.\nThis is cross sectional area out, this is\ndelta A, this is the V velocity and this is\nthe normal surface, this is the velocity and\nthis is the theta.\nNow, in time delta t this has progressed V\ndelta t and this length will be delta l. So,\nthis length that have progressed is delta\nln into delta A, so, a more clear figure.\nThis is the one that gives the more clearer\npicture, this is normal to the this is the\nvelocity and this makes an angle theta with\nthe normal direction. So, the component of\ndelta l in a normal direction is given us\ndelta ln.\nThe term B out represents the net flow rate\nof the property B from the control volume,\nyou see, its value can be thought of as arising\nfrom the addition of the contributions through\neach infinitesimal area element of size on\nthe portion del A of the control surface dividing\nregion 2 and control volume this surface is\ndenoted as CS out, that is what we talked\nabout, I was showing on the finger.\nSo, let us suppose, in time delta t the volume\nof fluid that passes across each element is\ngiven by delta ln into delta A, where delta\nln is delta l cos theta, in the previous figure,\nis the height of the small volume of element\nand theta is the rate at which B is carried\nout of the control volume across the small\nelement denoted, is angle between the velocity\nvector outward pointing normal to the surface\nand so theta is the, you know, the angle between\nthe velocity and the n cap.\nThus, since delta L is equal to V delta t,\nthe amount of property B carried across the\nelement area delta A, in the time interval\ndelta t is given by simple same thing b rho\nV cos theta del t into delta A, same now instead\nof V is V cos theta, direction. The rate at\nwhich B is carried out of the control volume\nacross this small element area delta A denoted\nby delta B out is so, so, delta B out is given\nby rho b delta A delta t or rho b V cos theta\ndelta t delta A / delta t, that is, rho b\nV cos theta delta A. So, this is the main,\nyou know, this is the delta B out.\nThe rate at which B is carried out of the\nis denoted by B out so, by integrating over\nthe entire outflow portion of the control\nsurface we obtain B out as integral of dB\nout as the rho b So, we substitute this rho\nb V cos theta delta A. The quantity V cos\ntheta is the component of the velocity normal\nto the area element delta A, from the definition\nof the dot product, this can be written as\nV cos theta as V dot n cap. Hence, an alternate\nform of the outflow rate is rho b V dot n\ncap multiplied by delta A.\nIn a similar fashion, by considering the inflow\nportion of a control surface CS in can be\nwritten as because it was negative sign rho\nb V dot n cap del A. So, for outflow region\njust remember V dot n cap is greater than\n0 and theta is between 90 degree and - 90\nto 90. So, for inflow region the normal component\nof V is negative and for out flow region it\nis positive. So, V dot n cap is less than\n0 and theta varies from 90 to 270 degree.\nSo, value of cos theta is therefore, positive\non the CV out portions of the control surface\nand negative on the CV in portions over the\nremainder of the control surface, there is\nno inflow or outflow leading to V dot n cap\nis equal to 0 on those portion. On such portion\neither V equal to 0 or cos theta is equal\nto 0.\nTherefore, showing the cross section in therefore\nthe net flux of the parameter B across the\nentire control surface can be written as B\nout – B in is equal to CS out rho b V dot\nn cap delta A, almost the same expression\njust the cross sections are different or we\ncan also write in over the entire cross section\nbecause at other places, this component is\n0. There is only a contribution at outside\nand inside which can be taken care of from\nthis expression.\nSo, this is where the integration is over\nthe entire control surface. By combining above\nequations we obtain DB sys / Dt is equal to\ndel Bcv delta t + control volume or control\nintegration over a control surface rho b V\ndot n into Del A.\nThis can be written in a slightly different\nform by using so, that Bcv is equal to rho\nb dV. We can also write this in this for del\ndel t of control volume. So, what we did?\nWe just this, one we wrote in this format.\nSo, now, this is the general form of Reynolds\ntransport theorem for a fixed non deforming\ncontrol volume.\nSo, now if we move from a system to a control\nvolume, you saw. We are going to cover this\nsometimes later. I think this is time now\nand the next step would be moving on from\nthis Reynolds transport theorem this is a\ngeneralized form. I hope you would have understood\nthat, just in case you have not you please\nlook at your books. I have tried to derive\nit to in the most simplest form.\nSo, in the next class what we are going to\nsee, we are going to apply this Reynolds transport\ntheorem to fluid dynamics where this property\nB, you know, can either be mass or momentum\nand then we are going to work, this can be\nanything because we have derived it for a\ngeneral system. So, B sys can be anything.\nSo, I think, this is enough for today and\nthe lectures will conclude that I hope to\nsee you in the next class. Thank you so much.",
    "video_9": "Welcome students, this is going to be the\nlast lecture for the basics of fluid mechanics\n2. Where we are going to see the conservation\nof momentum in more detail.\nSo, starting with the last slide, where we\nleft in the last lecture and the we derived\nthe general form of Reynolds transport theorem\nhere. So, this is the general form and now\nin the upcoming lecture and slides, what we\nare going to do is we will apply this Reynolds\ntransport theorem for derivation of different\nconservation equations.\nSo, now we are moving from a system to a control\nvolume. So, we will see, how when we apply\nB system to mass, what is going to happen.\nWe will see about linear momentum, we will\njust it can also be actually applied to moment\nof momentum, we are not going to cover that.\nThis principle can also be applied to the\nenergy conservation which we are also not\ngoing to see in this lecture.\nSo, we are concentrating mostly on mass and\nlinear momentum because this is of maximum\nuse in the upcoming regular lectures and hydraulic\nengineering course. So, I mean, the idea is\nthat we put it all together this basics of\nfluid mechanics 2 and proceed to our regular\nlectures on hydraulic engineering.\nSo, now conservation of mass, how can we apply,\nwhat we have learned in Reynolds transport\ntheorem to the conservation of mass. So, B\nis total amount of mass in the system, when\nwe do the conservation of mass B which we\nsaw in Reynolds transport theorem is the total\namount of mass in the system and b will be\nmass per unit mass which is equal to 1. So,\nwe have determined B and b for the conservation\nof mass. So, B is M, capital B is M and small\nb is 1.\nSo, this is the general form of Reynolds transport\nequation that we have derived in the previous\nlecture and the also we saw this in the first\nslide of today's lecture. So, this is the\ncontrol volume equation for the general Reynolds\ntransport theorem. And what we have done here\nis we have equated B system to mass of the\nsystem. As b is 1 this b is this simply this\nterm becomes rho dv and this also b here is\n1 so, it becomes a rho V dot n cap d A.\nSo, what is this, we know that in the conservation\nof mass the total mass of the system with\nrespect to the time DM, DM system by Dt is\nequal to 0. So, we can simply write in the\ncontrol volume rho V dot n cap d A over the\nentire cross section should be equal to – del\n/ del t times integral off rho dV. This is\nthe equation that we get by substituting B\nsystem as mass B as mass system and b as 1\nas we have seen. So, this is actually nothing\nbut a continuity equation.\nSo, I will just erase all the ink. So, it\nsays mass leaving minus mass entering you\nremember, we saw the property influx was the\nproperty leaving minus property entering,\nhere in this case is mass is equal to rate\nof increase of mass in the control volume.\nThis equation here, tells us that mass leaving\nminus mass entering is minus rate of increase\nof mass in the control volume.\nSo, now, we are going to see, so, unit vector\nn cap here is normal to the surface. So, this\nis the surface 1 which this is normal and\non the surface 2 it is in this direction.\nSo, as already indicated by the red arrows,\nand is pointed out of the control volume in\nboth the cross sections whether it is 1 or\n2, the unit vector is normal to the surface\nand pointed out of the control volume.\nSo, if the mass in the control volume is constant\nwhat we can say rho v dot n cap dA is equal\nto – del / del t of rho dV from the last\nslide. So, there is no rate of change of mass,\nif we assume, the mass in the control volume\nis constant, then this gives rho v dot n cap\ndA is equal to, so, here we assumed, uniform\nrho on the control surface in this one, so,\nrho can be taken out. So, we can simply write\nfor this particular case + - rho V bar A is\nequal to rate of change of mass or M mass\nper unit time.\nSo, we can simply write the velocity, average\nvelocity as here this quantity integral V\ndot n cap dA divided by the whole area of\ncross section. So, V bar is the spatially\naveraged velocity normal to the cross section,\nthis is important to note.\nSo, now continuity equation for constant density\nand uniform velocity, so, if there are 2 cross\nsections as we have seen in this, you know,\nthis problem. We can simply write rho 1 V\n1 dot n 1 cap dA is + rho 2 V 2 dot n 2 cap\ndA is equal to 0. So, density is constant\nacross this entire cross section. So, this\nwe can take out as indicated by these arrows\nhere. So, this one, can be simply written\nas, because the vector here was pointing outward.\nSo, if we take this direction as positive,\nthis n 1 cap will be negative, I mean, n the\nvector that will be negative sign, as shown\nhere – rho 1 V 1 bar A 1 + rho 2 V 2 bar\nA 2 is equal to 0, because the density same\nat the cross section 1 and cross section 2.\nSo, rho 1 rho 2 we can take out because it\nis the same. So, this gives us V 1 bar A 1\nis equal to V 2 bar A 2 is equal to Q. So,\nusing our Reynolds transport theorem or RTT\nabbreviated \nwe obtained equation of continuity. This is\nsame as we saw in fluid kinematics.\nSo, I am going to, you know, erase all the\nink and this has a dimension of litre cube\nper length cube by time, not litre cube, length\ncube by time. So, V 1 A 1 is equal to V 2\nA 2 is equal to Q. This is the simple version\nof the continuity equation for conditions\nof constant density. It is understood that\nthe velocities are either uniform or Spatially\naveraged in both cases this is the equation\nof continuity.\nSo, some examples of conservation of mass,\nthe flow out of reservoir, for example, is\n2 liters per second. The reservoir surface\nis 5 meters into 5 meter, the question is\nhow fast is the reservoir surface dropping.\nSo, you see the control surface that we have\ndrawn here, this is the entire height h, as\nalready indicated. So, the equation of continuity\nsays from Reynolds transport theorem rho V\ndot n cap dA is equal to - del / del t of\nrho dv. Because the total mass of the system\nthe control volume is not changing.\nThat is why we arrived at this equation. So,\nrho because it has the same density. So, we\ncan cancel these out. So, we get V dot n cap\ndA is equal to - del V del t . That is the\nentire volume, if we integrate the volume\nthe entire volume. So, or these can say Q\nout - Q in that is the flux leaving minus\nthe dis flux coming in is equal to - dV dt.\nThere is no nothing that is entering. So,\nQ in is 0 so, Q out will be simply - area\nof reservoir into d h / dt or we can simply\nwrite the rate of fall of height with respect\nto time is this - Q / area of the reservoir.\nSo, dh / dt is the velocity of the reservoir\nsurface. So, this is what we obtain, we can\nsubstitute Q is given 2 liters per second,\nwe can convert it into SI unit and area of\nthe reservoir, we can calculate, because it\nis rectangular in shape. So, this is also\nknown. So, we are able to calculate dh / dt.\nI think, I will leave this up to you to do\nthe numerical to derive the numerical values,\nwhich is the most simplest that you are able\nto find.\nSo, now the linear momentum equation. So,\nan example here is, if you see this figure\nhere, this is so, suppose if you shoot water\njet onto a wall for example, this is one of\nthis example where, you know, linear momentum\nis associated, there is a velocity with which\nwater is approaching and when it touches this\nwall it comes to rest. So, here we can actually\napply the momentum conservation linear momentum.\nSo, what happens is, as I said we are going\nto use the same concept of Reynolds transport\ntheorem for the linear momentum equation too.\nHere, I mean, in this particular case, the\nnet force is not going to be 0 because this\nmomentum before hitting the certain momentum\nand after hitting it turns to 0. So, the rate\nof change of momentum is force and the rate\nof change of momentum is not 0. Therefore,\nforce will not be going, I mean, there will\nbe some finite force. So, coming back to our\nReynolds transport equation, here, what we\ndo is so, this is the control volume equation,\nas I told you from the Reynolds transport\ntheorem.\nSo, what we do we say B in our case when we\nwant to derive the linear momentum equation\nB should be mass into velocity or called momentum.\nThis is very normal term, I mean, in fluid\nor any type of mechanics, mass into velocity\nis momentum. I will just take this away. And\nb by definition will be the property divided\nby mass. So, it will be m V as shown here\nm V / m, this can get cancelled, so it is\nmomentum per unit mass. So, be careful that\nthese are actually vectors.\nSo, now coming back to substituting this B\nhere and b, you know, here, so, substituting\nthis here and b here and here, this is the\nequation that we obtain. So, this equation\nit is going to be D m V Dt is equal to rho\nV dv dot n cap dA in for steady state, because\nthen if it is steady state, this term will\ngo to 0 for the steady state because there\nis no change in property with respect to time.\nSo, del del t of anything is going to be 0\nfor steady state solution. So, this is the\nma side of f is equal to ma equation. This\nis the mass into acceleration side of f = ma\nequation.\nSo, now, we similar to the mass we assume\ncross sections here and we use for the steady\nstate equation , the equation that we have\nobtained in this slide on the next page. So,\nD m V / Dt is equal to integral of rho V V\ndot n cap dA or in a simpler word V 1 if we\ntaking this as 1 and this as 2 V 1 rho 1 V\n1 dot n 1 cap dA + V 2 rho 2 V 2 dot n 2 cap\ndA or we can simply write it, rho 1 V 1 A\n1 into so, this V 1 will take care of the\ndirection and here this V 2 is going to take\ncare of this direction because this is pointing\noutward, if we take this direction as positive,\nso that is why this is negative.\nSo, assumption is, we have taken uniform density,\nwe have taken uniform velocity for writing\ndown this equation, we have taken V is always\nperpendicular to the area and we have taken\nsteady state. So, V is the fluid velocity\nrelative to the control volume.\nSo, m1 can be written as, - rho 1 V 1 A 1\ninto V 1 or - rho Q V 1. This is 1 term M\n1, so, it is written as - of rho Q into v1\nand similarly, M2 here can be written as,\nrho 2 V 2 A 2 into V 2 or rho Q V 2. So, this\nterm here and this term here, so, these M\n1, M 2, V 1, V 2, V 2 this v 1 all our vectors.\nSo, now, steady control volume form of Newton’s\nsecond law, so, this f the net force is the\nsum of M 1 and M 2 as we already told you\nin the last slide. So, sigma x where D mV\nDt is equal to M 1 + M 2. Now, the question\nis, what are the forces acting on fluid in\nthe control volume. So, one is gravity, other\nis shear at solid surface or pressure at solid\nsurface, pressure on the flow surfaces.\nSo, we can simply write, sigma F as, weight\nW due to gravity, pressure forces, solid surface\npressure and the force on due to pressure\nat wall and shear at wall. This is what we\nhave just said. So, why there is no shear\non the control surface? Because there is no\nvelocity tangent to the control surface there\nis no velocity that is tending to the control\nsurface like this.\nNow, going into a little zoom figure, now\nwe have indicated what M1 is, what pressure\nis, what force is due to the, you know, the\ndifferent pressure forces or the shear is\nthere. This is the weight, as you can see,\nand this is the frictional or the shear forces\nF ss x and F ss y, this are the components\nof the shear forces in 2 different directions.\nSo, forces by solid surface on fluid and the\nmomentum vectors have the same direction as\nthe velocity vectors, as we have seen, whatever\nthe direction of the velocity is the momentum\nwill be in the same direction. So, we can\nsimply write F = W + F P1 + F P2 + F ss and\nma force, mass into acceleration is M 1 +\nM 2, so, we can simply write M 1 + M 2 = W\n+ F p1 + F p2 + F ss, and M 1 here is - rho\nQ V 1 and M 2 is rho Q V 2, plus.\nAn example we are going to see is the reducing\nelbow using this equation, we have seen this\nequation already in the last slide, this is\nsectional 1, this is section 2, the distance\nbetween this is 1 meter. So, now question\nis, reducing elbow in vertical plane with\nwater flow of 300 liters per second. So, the\nQ is 300 liters per second. The volume of\nwater in the elbow is 200 litres that is the\ntotal volume. Energy loss is negligible. Calculate\nthe forces of the elbow on the fluid.\nSo, this is the question, what is going to\nbe the weight, - rho g into volume. So, if\nyou put volume as 200 liters. You are going\nto end with 1961 Newton in negative direction\nbecause weight acts downwards. Now, we treat\nsection 1 and section 2, we have to find the\ndiameter is 50 centimetres, this is what we\nhave seen, and diameter at section 2 is 30\ncentimetres. So, area will be 0.196 meters\nis square in section 1 and area will be 0.071\nmeters square the velocity is going to be\n1.53 m/s, we know the discharge and we know\nthe area, therefore, we will know the velocity\nand similarly for section 2 this shows the\ndirection so, this is the velocity directions\nat section 1 and this is the direction, velocity\ndirection at this section 2 here, in this\nway. Now the pressure is 150 kilo Pascal.\nWe need to find the pressure at section 2,\nM is because of the all the values we know\nwe can calculate M as - 459.\nHow can you find M, that you can see in the\nslide below, - rho Q V 1, M 2 is rho Q v 2,\nyou substitute that and you will be able to\nfind M and but the direction is same as velocity\nvector at section 1 and it will be 1270 Newton\nin this direction. So, Fp is going to be 29,400\nNewton, we are going to see actually a more\ndetailed problem in the upcoming slides. But\nthe pressure the forces due to the pressure\nis 29,400 Newton here. Now we have to find\nout the pressure force here. So that is the\nproblem.\nWhat is p 2? How do we obtain p 2? We can\nobtain p 2 using the Bernoulli equation. So,\np 2 will be p 1 + gamma z 1, just rearrangement\nof this equation gives this equation and we\ncan simply substitute the values and obtain\nz 1 – z 2,we already know, it is – 1 meter,\nV 1 square – V 2 square / 2g. So, V 1 we\nhave calculated, V 2 we have calculated, everything\nis known. So, actually p2 turns out to be\n132 kilopascal. Now, if we know p 2 we can\ncalculate the pressure force that will come\nout to be 9400 Newton.\nNow, it is important to find out the horizontal\nforces. This is what we have is, we have calculated\nthe vertical forces. So, the same M 1 + M\n2 = W + F p1 + F p2 + F ss. So, F ss is going\nto be M 1 + M 2 - W - F p1 - F p2 or F ss\nx, in x direction, because there are 2 components,\nit will be M1 x + M 2 x - W x - F p1 x - F\np2 x.\nM 1 x there is no component of 1 in horizontal\ndirection because M 1 was in this direction,\nW was again vertically acting, so, this is\nalso zero, and the pressure was also in this\ndirection, vertical direction, therefore this\nis also zero. So, F ss x is M 2 x – F p\n2 x, and this is M 2 x is 1270 Newton that\nwe already calculated, - of - 9400 Newton.\nAnd this came to be 10.7 kilo Newton, very\nsimple. Similarly, so, this is force of the\npipe on fluid. So, this means that the fluid\nis pushing pipe to the left because F ss x\nis positive.\nContinuing with our example, we have to find\nout F ss in z direction or y direction. Basically,\nwe call this one as z. So, M 2 z because this\nis a horizontal, this is zero and similarly\nwith the pressure force is it is zero. So,\nF ss z is M 1 - W z - Fp1 z. So, M 1z we found\nout it was - 459 Newton, weight we already\nfound out and this we just we calculated last\ntime, I mean, in the one slide before. So\nthis minus, minus becomes positive.\nBut still, F ss z comes - 27.9 kilo Newton.\nSo, this means approximately 28 kilo Newton\nforce is acting downwards on the fluid because\nit is minus. Now, pipe wants to move actually\nup that is why this the net force is in the\ndownward direction.\nNow, similarly, there is something called\nmoment of momentum equation, we are not going\ninto detail, but just to show that here the\nB, capital B for deriving moment of momentum\nequation we can assume, m r into V moment\nof momentum or m gamma into V, this r is actually\nnothing but gamma and b will be \nm r into V / m, so, moment of momentum per\nunit mass. So, actually the message here is\nthat this equation is Reynolds transport theorem\ncan be used to derive any of these conservation\nprinciples.\nSo, this is going to be 0, we are not going\ninto detail therefore this is. So, this is\nfor steady state because this is delta t equals\n0, we are not going to do the analysis.\nOne of the one of the examples is turbo machinery.\nBut I am going to skip this for your convenience,\nbut to know one of the examples of moment\nof momentum conservation equation in real\nlife is turbo machinery.\nNow, we can solve 1 practice problem, this\nwill be based mostly on the Bernoulli and\nmomentum or mass conservation equation. So,\na jet of oil relative density 0.80 issues\nfrom nozzle of 15 centimetre diameter with\na velocity of 12 meters per second. A smooth\ncone with vertex angle of 90 degree deflects\nthe jet. The jet is horizontal and the vertex\nof the cone points towards the jet. Calculate\nthe force required to hold the cone in position.\nSo, we have something like this. So, this\nis the this is the velocity of 12 meters per\nsecond the diameter hole is 15 centimetre\nand this is the cone and this is 90 degrees,\nthe jet is horizontal, the vertex of the cone\npoints towards the jet. So, actually most\nimportant thing in this type of problems is\nfirst draw the figure and then half our problem\nis solved. So, we have successfully drawn\nthe finger now. Now the solution steps is\nwe consider the control volume as shown in\nthe figure.\nSo, this is our control volume, you see, that\nis the first step, the pressure is everywhere\natmospheric, as the cone is smooth by neglecting\nthe frictional the friction the velocity of\nthe sheet of water over the cone is V everywhere.\nThe inclination of the velocity to the axis\nis 45 degrees that we have simply assumed.\nSo, the area is going to be pi / 4 d square,\nthe area here, and rho is going to be, its\noil of relative density pointed. So, rho is\ngoing to be 0.8 into 998 a density of water,\nthat is, 798.4 kilograms per meter cube.\nSo, the Q is area into velocity AV, area we\nhave already calculated. So, area is here,\nand this is the velocity that we already know\nfrom here. And this comes out to be 0.2121\nmeter cube per second.\nSo, by momentum equation in x direction, so,\nyou see, there is 0, if the reaction force\nhere is R x. So, 0 - R x, is the change in\nmomentum. And what is the change in momentum.\nIt is rho Q, if the velocity V was there,\nV cos 45 degrees - V, or V can come out, you\nknow, R x is equal to rho Q V 1 - cos 45 degrees.\nYou see here, there is one force R x that\nis going to act, so, rate of change of momentum\nis rho Q V 1 - cos 45 degrees, you substitute\nthe value rho QV 1 - cos 45 degrees and that\nis going to be R x is equal to 595 Newton.\nBy symmetry we can see R y is equal to 0.\nSo, hence, the resultant reaction force on\nthe fluid is R is equal to R x. Thus, the\nforce required to hold the cone in position\nis F is equal to 595 Newton long the negative,\nnegative x direction. This is one of the examples\nof this. In some point during the lecture\nseries, we are going to solve more problems,\nwe will have some sessions where we are going\nto solve only some random problems from fluid\nmechanics on the other topics that we are\ngoing to do.\nAnd I think this is enough and this concludes\nour basics of fluid mechanics 2 section. We\nwill start next week with laminar and turbulent\nflows. Thank you so much for watching.",
    "video_10": "Welcome back to this week’s lecture of hydraulic\nengineering. We are going to study about laminar\nand turbulent flows. This is the week 3 of\nthis module and this will comprise of almost\n5 lectures of half an hour each. So, proceeding\nto laminar and turbulent flow, its important\nto tell you about what these types of flows\nare.\nSo, my question to you is, have you ever observed\nthe candle smoke plume? If you have observed,\nyou would note that when the smoke plume above\nthe candle flame there will be a smooth part,\nyou know, and there will be a rough part of\nthe smoke. So, this part actually indicates\nthis laminar flow and this is the one that\nis turbulent flow. We will go into more detail\nabout what laminar and turbulent flow now.\nAs I said, what you are going to observe is\nthat smoke actually rises smoothly for initial\nfew centimeters. And then without, you know,\nfurther going upwards maybe just a little\nbit upward after going that the plume starts\nfluctuating randomly in all direction or,\nyou know, in other words, the flow becomes\nturbulent and this is indicative of laminar\nflow. The figure has been adapted from Cengel’s\nbook Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Application,\nMcGraw-Hill Higher Education Publication.\nSo, as I said, the flow regime in the first\ncase that is the first case.\nIt is called the laminar flow or smooth streamlines\nare there and it is actually a very highly\nordered motion, so, no problems so at all,\nvery, very smooth. In the second case the\nflow regime is turbulent, this means, the\nvelocity fluctuations are there and it is\na highly disordered motion. So, any chaos,\nyou know, any fluctuations in the velocity\nis called turbulence. And this is the flow\nthat is associated with this is called a turbulent\nflow. So, what we observe is fluid flow in\na pipe is laminar when at low velocities.\nSo, if the velocity is very low the flow in\nthe fluid can be laminar, and as the velocity\nincreases the flow becomes turbulent. So,\nhigher velocities are associated with turbulent\nflow and lower velocities are associated with\nlaminar flows, this is the most general thing.\nBut it also depends on some other parameters\nwhich we will see in the upcoming slides.\nSo, if the flow is laminar whether the flow\nis turbulent it does not only depend on the\nvelocities.\nWhat happens in nature practically most of\nthe flows in the nature are at turbulent,\nmost of flow, we rarely find laminar flow.\nOne real-life example of a laminar flow actually\noccurs in the our blood system. So, in the\nveins and in the arteries the flow can be\nlaminar, actually it is laminar. We will tell\nyou the reasons why later. Laminar flow can\nalso occur when a highly viscous fluids, such\nas, oil flow through a narrow pipe or passages.\nSo, if you pay attention to what I have said\njust now, just before that, why the flow in\nthe blood is laminar, you can actually understand.\nSo, this is this could be the, you see, narrow\npipes. We will see numerically also why soon,\nwhy the flow in the blood is laminar. Now\nthe factor on which the flow regime, flow\nregime means whether it is laminar or turbulent\ndepends on the Reynolds number Re. What is\nthis Reynolds number? Reynolds number is a\ndimensionless number which is the ratio of\nthe inertial forces divided by the viscous\nforces sorry.\nSo, it is the ratio of inertial forces to\nviscous forces or inertial forces by viscous\nforces. Mathematically it is given as, V average\nmultiplied by D divided by nu, so, this has\nsomething to do with this viscosity, that\nis, why viscous forces, you see, and this\nhas something to do with inertia. This Reynolds\nequation for Reynolds number is one of the\nmost important thing in this course, it will\nyou will encounter the Reynolds number more\nthan you can imagine in this course. So, I\nwould recommend that you remember this Reynolds\nnumber as inertial forces by viscous forces.\nHere, V average is the average flow velocity\nin meters per second, D is the characteristic\nlength of the geometry, it can be anything,\nit could be the diameter, it could be the\nlength and nu is the kinematic viscosity of\nthe fluid. This can vary from, you know, problem\nto problem or geometry to geometry. For example,\nif you consider sand grain it has it can be\nnothing other than the sand diameter, if you\nconsider a pipe it cannot be anything else,\nother than, the pipe diameter, for example.\nSo, Reynolds number is very important, you\nhave to note that again. So, velocity into\ncharacteristic length by viscosity.\nFor example, for flow through pipes, if the\nReynolds number is less than 2300, we consider\nthe flow as laminar flow, important to remember.\nSo, if you are given, the pipe diameter, the\nflow velocity, you can easily tell if the\nflow is laminar or turbulent. What you can\ndo is, you can calculate Reynolds number as\nVD by nu, this is known, this is told and\nD is also told. So, you can calculate Reynolds\nnumber. For Reynolds number between 2300 and\n4000 the flow is transitional.\nSo, there is one other category of flow apart\nfrom laminar and turbulent called transitional\nflow, which means that the laminar regime\nhas just ended and the fully turbulent regime\nhas not yet started. So, some of the flow\ncould be laminar, sorry, the flow could have\nstill some laminar properties and some turbulent.\nBut when the Reynolds number goes over and\nabove 4000 for pipe flow this becomes, the\nflow becomes fully turbulent, this is you\nknow a guideline.\nSo, remembering all these three values is\nnot a bad idea. If you also, I mean, some\nbooks will say 2100 as well, but the idea\nis it should be around 2000 laminar flow.\nSo, around 2000, 22-2300 is the value recommended\nby many books. All these velocities, I mean,\nthe all these velocity measurements and Reynolds\nnumber measurement is experimental in nature.\nSo, now laminar flow in circular pipes, so,\nafter dealing telling you the basics of how\nto define the, you know, how to define and\nfind what laminar and turbulent flow is, we\nare going to see some of the properties of\nlaminar flow in circular pipes. So, for deriving\nanything there are certain assumptions first\nthat we have to take. We have to assume steady\nflow, what does this assumption of steady\nflow mean, that the situation or the condition\nis not dependent on time.\nSecond assumption is, it is laminar flow,\nthis means the Reynolds number is fairly less\nthan 2300, as we have seen in the last slide.\nAnd the flow is incompressible which means\ndensity is constant, the density does not\nchanges either in space or with time. And\nwe also have to assume the flow is fully developed,\nthat means there is no, you know, intermittent\nphenomenon that is happening, a flow has happened\nover a long period of time. And then we are\ngoing to calculate the properties.\nBecause when the flow start the situation\nit is actually first thing that will happen\nis it being non-steady, you know, it will\nchange the function. After flow is fully developed,\nyou know, the flow has happened over a long\nperiod of time and then the flow becomes fully\ndeveloped it has occupied the entire pipe,\nfor example, so, it is fully developed. Fully\ndeveloped has something to do with the boundary\nlayer phenomenon that is why I have not mentioned\nit before but we will see it in the next week.\nNow, after going through the assumptions,\nwe will consider a coaxial ring shaped fluid\nelement of radius ‘r’ whose thickness\nis ‘dr’ and length is ‘dx’ and the\nflow is from left to right. As I said, the\nbest way to describe a problem is to draw\nit. So, what we have assumed is, we have assumed\na coaxial ring shaped fluid element of radius\n‘r’. So, this is the flow, you know, this\nis the profile and we have assumed this fluid\nelement, which having thickness ‘dr’ and\nlength ‘dx’ and the flow is happening\nfrom left to right in this direction.\nSo, we have kept this figure for the forces\nin the right hand side. So, if you see, there\nwill be pressure forces acting P x from the\nleft, P x + P pressure force are at x + dx\nfrom the right and then there will be shear\nforces acting here, in this direction and\nthere will be shear forces acting at Tr +\ndr, you know, and if we apply the force balance,\nso, this the force due to this will be 2 pi\nr into dr, so, pressure into area will be\nthe force, this is the area and this is the\npressure. At x, - 2 pi r dr, this is again\nthe area multiplied by P at x + dx.\nNow, this one, force acting in this direction\nwhich is positive in sign and there is another\nforce acting in the negative direction, so,\nthat is what we have done. So, again this\nis a shear force, so, we have multiplied this\ntau here, the one here, with 2 pi r dx, because\nthis is the thickness over which it is, I\nmean, so, this is the length over which it\nis acting. So, this was if you see, this was\ndx and this was dr. So, multiplication of\ndr was done for pressure at, I mean, for this\nforce and this force, however, multiplication\nwith x will be done for the tau shear stress\nand the shear stress here.\nSo, this was positive sign, 2 pi r x dx in\nthe area and the shear stress is tau at r\nminus, because this is the minus 1, because\nit is in the negative x direction, same area\n2 pi r dx into tau at r + dr. So, this denotes\nwhere this force is, it is at x, this is at\nx + dx, this is at r and this is at r + dr\nlocation. So, now if we rearrange this equation\nhere, equation 1 and we divide both sides\nby 2 pi r dr into dx.\nSo, this equation will come out to be, r P\nx + dx - P x by dx, because 2 pi r dr will\nbe cancelled from here and here. So, this\nis the first term and the second term will\nhappen. So, here, 2 pi r dx will be cancelled\nout and the dr will be remaining. So, it will\nbe this term and both will be sum will be\nequal to 0 very simple to obtain, just considering\nthis and this. So, this is another equation\nthat we call equation number 2.\nNow, equation number 2 can be written as simply\nyou see, so this is pressure at x + dx - P\nx by dx, so it can be written as, dP dx and\nthis can be written as, d r into tau dr. So,\nthis is the differential form of the equation.\nNow, if we use the standard tau is equal to\nminus mu du dr, why do we do this? Actually\nthis is an assumption for \nlaminar flow. So, if we have a laminar flow\nwe can assume shear stress as a function of\nminus, you know, as a function of du dr or\nin other terms tau is equal to minus mu du\ndr.\nSo, minus mu du by dr, this is laminar flow.\nSo, if we use this equation here, then what\nwe get? We can get, mu by r d dr of r du dr\nis equal to dP dx because this minus will\nmake it come on this side and this dP dx can\nbe on the left side, right side.\nSo, now what is dP dx? So, to find dP dx,\nwe have to consider the force balance on fluid\nelement of radius R. So, we consider a fluid\nelement of radius R, it is quite simple, their\npressure here is P. So, it becomes pi R square\nP, this force and this force is pi R square\nP + dP and the same thing is there is the\nshear stress acting here. So, this is the\ntau w. So, almost the same type of equation\nis there, pi R square P - pi R square P +\ndP force balance - 2 pi Rdx tau w.\nSo, this is the wall. So, what we get is,\nif you see, the equation that we get here\nis, dP by dx is equal to minus 2 tau w by\nR which is a constant. So, if we integrate\nthis equation, equation 4, so, this is the\nequation 4, after obtaining this result here.\nWhat we are going to get if we integrate this?\nWe will get, u as a function of r is, r square\nby 4 mu because dp dx was constant, dP dx\n+ C1 ln r + C1 + C2, this is an important\nequation. So, now we will talk about some\nboundary conditions. Boundary conditions are\nsomething that we used to determine the constants\nof these equations. So, one of the boundary\ncondition is that we had actually used in\nthe derivation of dP dx that, you know, u\nis equal to 0 at when radius is equal to capital\nR. This is called no slip condition at pipe\nwall because pipe wall is at rest.\nSo, the fluid element adjacent to the wall\nwill also be at rest. So, u at r is equal\nto small r is equal to capital R is 0. Another\nthing we will have the uPrime at R is equal\nto 0 or at the center line it is going to\nbe 0 that is symmetry about the center line.\nSo, if we utilize the above boundary conditions,\nequation 5 will take the following form. So,\nr C 1 and C 2 will be eliminated and we will\nhave u as a function of r will be given as\nminus R square by 4 u multiplied by dP dx\nwhole multiplied by 1 minus small R square\nby capital R square. And this is velocity\nprofile which is parabolic in nature, this\nis important to note, you see, this part here\nis parabolic.\nSo, this now you can recollect and see why\nwe started with this particular profile because\nin reality in derivation you will find this\nprofile which is parabolic in nature. So,\nu as a function of r if you find out if you\nput r is equal to R at boundary just check\nu R, so is going to be 0 this is satisfied.\nBut actually we use this assumption to derive,\nso, we should not say that this is actually\na check of the equation because of course\nit is going to be that because that was the\nboundary condition.\nNow, what is being what will be the average\nvelocity, maximum velocity and the discharge\nin this type of flow. So, the average velocity\nwill be integration of velocity with a small\narea divided by entire area, this is the definition\nof average velocity. And if you put, u r as\nwhat we have obtained from the last slide\nand if you assume that small element it is\nthe area will be 2 pi r dr, correct.\nSo, if you put u r is equal to this and area\nis 2 pi r dr, then you are going to obtain\nthe average velocity as minus R square by\n8 mu multiplied by dP dx, this is again an\nimportant. So, these are some of the top,\nI mean, things that you get in gate as well\ngate. So, now you have obtained the average\nvelocity. So, if you see, the velocity profile,\nparabolic profile you can easily actually\nsee the maximum velocity, sorry, the maximum\nvelocity occurs at r is equal to 0.\nSo, if we put r is equal to 0 in the equation\nfrom the last slide, that is, equation 6 u\nmax will be minus R square by 4 mu dP dx.\nAnd it is very, if you see the relation, u\nmax is equal to 2 times u average, if you\ndivide this, divide this by divide this you\nwill get 1 by 2. So, you see, so, this is\nthe V average here, and this is the u or V\nwhatever you want to say, or u max is equal\nto 2 V average and the simply the total discharge\nis going to be V average into a, that is,\nminus pi. So, V average we already know, and\nyou multiply the area. So, you will get, so,\nit is R square already, and then what do you\nmultiply with pi R square, and this is the\nQ that you are going to get.\nSo, now we are going to see the first problem\nfrom the laminar flow. So, the problem is,\nthere is a liquid X which is flowing through\na 4 centimeter diameter, horizontal and a\ncircular pipe at 40 degree centigrade. This\nis what we have done before. The flow velocity\nat the centerline of the pipe is measured\nto be 6 meter per second. So, basically what\nthis says we have measured the centerline\nvelocity of the pipe.\nWe have to determine the flow velocity profile.\nThe density and the dynamic viscosity of the\nliquid x at 40 degree centigrade are, so,\nthey are telling us the density is this one\n1252 kilogram per meter cube and dynamic viscosity\nis point 3073 Pascal second. So, they have\ntold a certain piece of information and we\nhave to solve this problem. So, how do we\ndo that. Now I what I am going to do is, I\nam going to use the white screen for that\nand the best way is first we have to write\nwhat are the things that are given.\nSo, we have to write the things that are given.\nSo, we are given the diameter is equal to\n4 centimeter, which is 4 into 10 to the power\nminus 2 meters. Therefore, the radius is going\nto be D by 2 or simply, 2 into 10 to the power\nminus 2 meter. We are also given the centerline\nvelocity which is, we have seen in our derivation\nas, u max, that is, 6 meters per second. We\nare also told that density is 1252 kilogram\nper meter cube and also the kinematic viscosity\nin SI unit is point 3073 Pascal second.\nSo, what was the first thing that we did?\nWe wrote down everything that is given. This\nis the very good practice. So, this is for\nan assumption that the flow is laminar, so,\nwe say let the flow is laminar. Therefore,\nV average is going to be u max / 2 and, that\nis, 6 / 2 is equal to 3 meters per second.\nSo, now we have assumed that the flow is laminar,\nwe have to check also. Therefore, first, we\nhave to check the Reynolds number we say,\nReynolds number is rho V average.\nThis is one term multiplied by D by mu. Because\nin the definition that we saw, it was nu and\nnu is mu by rho, so rho goes up, so it is\n1252 into 3 into 4 into 10 to the power minus\n2 divided by point 3073 and that comes almost\n489. So, Reynolds number is without dimension\nthat is very, 489 which implies that this\nis laminar flow and therefore our assumption\nof \nlaminar flow is correct. So, we will go to\nanother page. So, we will go to white screen\nagain.\nSo, we say for laminar flow in circular pipes\nu of r is written as very, minus R square\nby 4 mu dP dx, this was the formula that we\nderived already and we know many values. So,\nwe can simply write, minus R, we already know,\n2 into 10 to the power minus 2 divided by\n4 into 0.3073, dP dx we do not know into 1\n- r square, capital R we know, 2 into 10 to\nthe power minus 2 whole square. So, this is\nthe profile that we are able to find. If you\nwant to simplify it further, we can simply\nwrite, u of r as minus 1 by 3073 dP dx into\n1 - r square 4 into 10 to the power minus\n4.\nSo, we have derived u as a function of r.\ndP dx is something that we do not know, I\nmean, or if we know this then our problem\nwill be solved. So, I will just go to the\nscreen on white screen and this is what was\nasked, to determine the flow velocity profile.\nSo, now I think we will start with another\nproblem in our next lecture. So, I will just\nshowing you the problem I am not going to\nrepeat it this question because we will start\nour next lecture with this particular problem.\nSo thank you for watching and we resume in\nthe upcoming lecture, thank you so much.",
    "video_11": "Welcome back to this lecture.\nAs we were talking, we are going to start\nwith another problem of laminar flow in pipes.\nThe question says that the crude oil of viscosity\n0.9 poise and specific gravity 0.8 is flowing\nthrough a horizontal circular pipe of diameter\n80 millimeters and length of 15 meter.\nCalculate the difference of pressure at the\n2 ends of the pipe, if 50 kilograms of oil\nis collected in a tank in 15 seconds.\nSo, we are knowing this is mu, this is specific\ngravity S is 0.8.\nSo, we know the diameter is 80 millimeters\nand the length is 15 meters.\nSo, going back to, you know, we are going\nto have a white screen.\nSo, as always what we are going to do, we\nare going to write the things that are actually\ngiven.\nGiven thing is mu is 0.9 poise or in SI unit\nis 0.09 Pascal seconds.\nWe know it is specific gravity S is 0.8.\nTherefore, the density is given to be 0.8\nand if we assume 1000 kilograms per meter\ncube density of water, so, the density of\nthe fluid is 800 kilograms per meter cube,\nsince, S is rho / rho water.\nDiameter we know, it is 80 millimeters or\n80 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, R we\nknow 40 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter\nand length L is given as 15 meter.\nSo, these are the things that we already know\nfrom before.\nSo, first we are going to do, we are going\nto calculate the volume of oil collected in\na tank in 15 seconds is equal to mass of oil\ncollected \nin 15 seconds divided by density of oil and\nthat is going to be 50 divided by 800 that\nis 0.0625 meter cube.\nThis is the volume of the oil that is collected\nin a tank in 15 second.\nTherefore, discharge Q is equal to volume\nby time equal to 0.0625 divided by 15, Q is\n4.17 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter cube\nper second.\nSee, calculate the area of the pipe, area\nof the pipe is pi D square / 4 and, that is,\npi by 4 into diameter was 80 into 10 to the\npower minus 3 and this gives us 5.026 into\n10 to the power minus 3 meters square.\nSo, the average velocity is Q by area and\nthis will give us 4.17 into 10 to the power\nminus 3 divided by 5.026 into 10 to the power\nminus 3 is equal to 0.83 meters per second.\nTherefore, we will find the Reynolds number\nthat is, rho V average into D / mu and this\nrho is 800, V average is 0.83, diameter is\n80 into 10 to the power minus 3, mu is 0.09.\nThis is actually very important to check and\nthis comes to around 590.\nSo, as Reynolds number is less than 23 the\nflow is laminar.\nSo, we are going to do the again white screen.\nSo, we have established \nthat flow is laminar, therefore, Q is going\nto be the formula that we have derived minus\n8 minus pi divided by 8 mu dp dx into R to\nthe power 4.\nSo, Q value we already know, that is, 4.17\ninto 10 to the power minus 3 is equal to minus\npi 8 into 0.09 dp dx into R, we know, 40 into\n10 to the power minus 3 to the power 4, what\nwe get is dp dx is equal to minus 373.32 Newton\nper meters square per meter.\nThis means, this is the dp dx and it is constant,\nso, the pressure difference per unit length\nis minus 373.37.\nIf we assume P 2 pressure at one end and P\n1 at other and length is 15 this should be\nequal to dp dx equal to - 373.32 implies P\n2 – P 1 the pressure difference between\nthe both end is - 5599 Newton per meter square.\nSo, this \nis the final calculation.\nThis was the difference of pressure.\nSo, that came out to be finally and right\nhere, P 2 - P 1 came out to be minus 5599\nNewton per meters square.\nSo, this is how we solved a detailed solution.\nLet me take down this ink.\nSo, now we have done the laminar flow through\nthe circular pipe.\nNow we are going to see the laminar flow between\nthe parallel plates.\nSo, this is a parallel plate.\nSo, whatever assumptions that we have made\nfor laminar flowing pipes are valid here also.\nIn this case both the plates are fixed plate\nand this is also fixed plate.\nAs you can observe, this is x direction and\nthis is y direction.\nThe thick the distance between the plate is\ngiven by t, the flow is in this direction\npositive x axis and what we have assumed is\nan element having the thickness this length\nis delta x and this is delta y this is the\ndirection.\nAnd as we have written all the forces in a\nsimilar fashion as we did it for the pipe\nflow.\nSo, if the pressure is P here, so, the force\nby per unit meter is P delta y from this side,\nif the pressure if there is a pressure gradient\ndP dx.\nSo, over the length delta x the pressure will\nbecome P + delta P delta P / delta x into\ndelta x.\nThis will be multiplied by the area delta\ny into 1 because we have assumed a unit length\non the other direction.\nSimilarly, tau delta x force is the force\nper unit meter per unit length.\nAnd if we assume that the shear stress is\nincreasing in this direction by delta tau\ndelta y, so, this is the force in the other\ndirection.\nSo, as you can see, pressure forces acting\nin this direction, pressure forces acting\nin this direction, on the bottom side, this\nis the shear forces acting in negative x direction\nand here it is acting in positive direction.\nSo, with this in background, we start to write\nthe force or we do the force balance analysis\nalong the flow direction.\nSo, for your convenience I have made the free\nbody diagram that is there, I have just reproduced\nit in the top corner.\nYou see, P delta y, that is, force per unit\nlength minus this one here and this again\nis in the negative direction tau delta x.\nSo, minus tau delta x and this is in positive\ndirection, so, this is plus and that all equals\n0.\nNow, if we divide both sides by delta x into\ndelta y, that is, area, what we are going\nto get is, so, this becomes P delta x delta\ny and this also become P delta x into delta\ny whole square.\nSo, this will get cancelled here, here.\nSo, if you do these cancellations what we\nare actually left with is dP dx here and d\ntau dy, rest of the things will get cancelled.\nSo, this is one important equation that we\nare going to get.\nSo, dP dx is equal to d tau dy.\nNow, this is again a laminar flow assumption\nand also we will also assume that the mu the\nviscosity is constant.\nSo, it will be d square u / dy square is equal\nto 1 / mu dP dx.\nThis is the equation that we get after we\nput in this, this is equation 8.\nNow, because here it is double integral, so\nwe will integrate it twice.\nSo, we will get u is equal to 1/mu dP dx into\ny square / 2 + C 1 y + C 2, because we have\nassumed y, you see, y is in this direction.\nSo, this is the equation we get.\nNow, the boundary conditions are u at y equal\nto 0 if the plate is fixed.\nSo, due to no slip condition the velocity\nwill be 0 also at the thickness at the other\nend after the distance t.\nAlso because of no slip condition the velocity\nis going to be 0.\nAnd if we use these boundary conditions in\nequation 9, we get u = - 1 / 2 mu dP dx into\nty - y square.\nSo, I will just quickly try to tell you how\nit is done.\nWe know at so because so that you are able\nto repeat it at home.\nSo, what we say, u at y is equal to 0 0.\nSo, in this equation, we know, at y is equal\nto 0, so, put this u is 0 at 1 / mu dp dx,\ny is 0 square / 2 + C 1 into 0 plus C 2, this\nwill give C 2 = 0.\nAnd if you do u at y is equal to t so u at\ny is equal to t is also 0.\nSo, 1 / mu dP dx and y here is t, so t square\n/ 2 + C 1t because we already found out C\n2 is 0.\nThis is how you will obtain C 1.\nC 1 is going to be minus 1 / mu dP dx t / 2\nand you substitute T and C 1 and C 2 in these\nequations and this is how you end up in this\ny.\nSorry, this u.\nSo this is the final equation for you after\nsubstituting the boundary conditions.\nThis is also something that you can try to\nremember because it is quite simple.\nHere, also the velocity distribution is parabolic,\nyou see, ty - y square, parabolic in nature.\nThis is how it looks.\nNow, repeating the same procedure of average\nvelocity, maximum velocity and discharge.\nThe average velocity is again given by integral\n0 to t udy / t and if you put u as obtained\nin the last slide here, what we are going\nto obtain is minus 1 / 12 mu dP dx t square.\nI would say please do these as homework exercise.\nIf you have any problem, message me on forum.\nAnd you not only this V average, but I request\nyou to also do this for the flow through the\npipes that we covered in the last lecture.\nNow, you see, the velocity profile is parabolic.\nThis means the maximum velocity again is at\nthe center line, which is y is equal to t\n/ 2 and if you obtain y is equal to t / 2\nin the equation that we obtained in the equation\nnumber 10, then we can get u max, which comes\nout to be minus 1 / 8 mu dP dx into t square.\nMy recommendation is also try this, and if\nyou are unable to, contact me on the forum.\nSo, if you divide u max / V average, what\nwe get is, actually u maximum is 1.5 times\nV average, In the pipe flow it was, in pipe\nflow it was u max was 2 times V average.\nHere, it is 1.5 times to V average and Q is\nsimply V average into A. So, V average we\nalready know, 1/12 mu and the area is simply\nt because we are considering the per unit\nlength.\nSo, that we multiply the per unit length t,\nso, that becomes t square become t cube.\nSo, these are some of the formulas that you\nmust be remembering.\nNow, we will solve one problem from this So,\nthe question is determine the pressure gradient,\nthe shear stress at the 2 horizontal parallel\nplates and the discharge per unit width of\nthe laminar flow of a liquid with maximum\nvelocity of 2 meters per second between the\n2 horizontal parallel fixed plates, which\nare 100 millimeters apart.\nWe assume that mu is equal to 2.4525 Pascal's\nper second.\nSo, this any to solve this any problem what\nwe do is we simply, you know, write first\nthe things that we know from before.\nSo, I will just start writing down.\nFirst we write out the things that are given.\nGiven is the flow is laminar, u max is given\nas 2 meters per second, thickness is given\nas 100 millimeters or 0.1 meters, mu is given\nas 2.4525 Pascal second.\nNow, u max is 1.5 V average.\nThis is which we have found out implies V\naverage is going to be 2 divided by 1.5, that\nis, 1.33 meters per second.\nSo, for laminar flow between 2 parallel plates,\nV average is equal to – 1 / 12 mu dP dx\ninto t square.\nWe simply start putting in the values of V\naverage, – 1 / 12 mu is 2.4525, as given\nin the question, dP dx we do not know and\nthickness we know 0.1 square.\nThis will on solution if you use the calculator\nyou will get dP dx is equal to - 39142 Newton\nper meter square per meter.\nSo, this is the first part, I mean, where\nwe first thing that we do is we obtain dP\ndx.\nNow, what I do is choose the white screen\nagain.\nFor the another part.\nSo, here we have approximated the value of\nV average as 1.33 meters per second.\nBut if we use V average is equal to 4 / 3\nwhich is 1.33 meters per second we can get,\nI mean, there is I am just trying to show\nthere will be slight difference, of course,\nnot that much, but it will be minus 3924 Newton\nper meter square per meter, I mean, very,\nvery, almost not very difference.\nSo, now we know that u is minus 1 / 2 mu dP\ndx into ty – y square.\nSo, du / dy will be minus 1 / 2 mu dP dx t\n- 2y and du / dy at one plate will be equal\nto minus 1 / 2 mu into dP dx into t.\nFor tau not at the wall is going to be mu\ndu / dy at y is equal to 0.\nSo, tau not is going to be, this tau not I\nwill solve on the next sheet so, sorry, first\nlet me do the eraser.\nSo, I am choosing another sheet now, white\nscreen.\nSo, tau not is going to be, writing that equation\nagain mu du / dy, at y is equal to 0, which\nwe have already actually calculated.\nTherefore, tau not is going to be 2.4525 into\n- 1 / 2 mu dP dx into t or tau not is equal\nto 2.4525 into - 1 / 2 into 2.4525 and dP\ndx was - 3924 into 0.1.\nSo, tau not is coming out to be 196.2 Newton\nper meter square.\nNow, discharge per unit width Q is – 1 / 12\nmu dP dx into t cube.\nTherefore, Q is going to be minus 1 / 12 into\n2.4525 into - 3924 into 0.1 whole cube.\nSo, Q is 0.133 meter cube per second.\nSo, I will erase all the ink here.\nSo, final answers is going to be one is the\nfirst one is pressure gradient, that was,\nrequired dP dx came out to be minus 3924 Newton\nper meter square per meter.\nSecond one was shear stress at the plates,\nthat is, tau not equal to 196.2 Newton per\nmeter square.\nAnd the third one was discharge per unit width\nQ is equal to 0.1333 meter cube per second.\nSo, these are the final answers.\nSo, this was the problem that we have solved\nnow.\nThere is one more problem, but I think it\nis nice time to end this lecture here.\nAnd we will resume our next lecture by solving\nthis problem.\nThank you so much, and I will see you in the\nnext lecture.\nBye.",
    "video_12": "Welcome back to this lecture of turbulent\nand fluid flow, sorry, laminar and turbulent\nflow. We are going to start with from that\npoint where we left, that was, we are going\nto solve yet another problem on the laminar\nflow.\nSo, the question here is, water is flowing\nbetween 2 large parallel plates which are\n2 millimeters apart. So, that is, means t\nis 2 millimeter. Determine the maximum velocity,\nthe pressure drop per unit length, that is,\ndp dx and the sheer stress at the wall of\nthe plate if the average velocity is 0.4 meters\nper second. And viscosity of water is given\nas 0.01 poise. So, to solve this, what I will\ngo to the white screen and first write down\nwhat all things are given.\nSo, given thing is as I told you, t is 2 millimeters\nor 2 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, the\naverage velocity is also given 0.4 meters\nper second, mu is given as 0.01 poise which\nwill be divided by 10 to obtain into 10 to\nthe power minus 3 Pascal second, and at density\nof water is assumed to be 1000 kilogram per\nmeter cube. So, we write the equation that\nwe had derived. Now, u is written as minus\n1 / 2 mu dp dx into t y minus y square, u\nis maximum at t is equal to, at y is equal\nto t / 2.\nThis means, u max is equal to minus 1 / 8\nmu dp dx into t square. Also u max is equal\nto 1.5 V average. This implies that u max\nis equal to 1.5 and this is 0.4 from here\nand that comes out to be 0.6 meters per second.\nSo, that is, the first, the second u max is\nalso written as minus 1 / 8 mu into dp dx\nt square. So, if you substitute the value\nof u max, that is, 0.8 is equal to minus 1\n/ 8 into 0.001 and dp dx is what we need to\ndetermine and t is 2 millimeters. So, 2 into\n10 to the power minus 3 whole square and this\nway we can obtain dp dx is equal to minus\n1200 Newton per meter squared per meter, so,\nminus 1200 Newton.\nSo, yeah, it should be minus 1200 Newton per\nsquare per meter. I will take care. I think\nthe sheet is being hidden by my photo. Anyways,\nI will proceed to the third subpart.\nI will erase all the ink on this slide and\nthe third part is tau not is equal to mu du\ndy at y is equal to 0. So, tau not is mu du,\nwe know u, so, we can differentiate that and\nobtain minus 1 / 2 mu dp dx into t and substituting\nthe values mu is minus 1 / 2 into minus 1200\ninto 2 into 10 to the power minus 3. So, tau\nnot is going to be 1.2 Newton per meter square.\nSo, this is the solution to the question number\n4. This was the third part. So, going back\nto the screen, so, this problem is solved\nnow.\nNow, we will solve one more problem, the last\nproblem of the series of laminar flow around\nplates. It is a little inquisitive question.\nThe velocity profile for the fully developed\nlaminar flow of a Newtonian fluid between\n2 large plate is given by, so, we have been\ngiven a new profile u y is given as 3 u not\n/ 2 1 minus y / h whole square / 2, where\n2h is the distance between 2 plates, u not\nis the velocity at the center plane and y\nis the vertical coordinate from the center\nplane.\nSo, more importantly, the frame of reference\nor x and y axis is not at the bottom but it\nstarts from the middle between the plates.\nFor the plates of width b, obtain a relationship\nof flow rate through the plates. So, what\nwe are going to do, we are going to solve\nit and as always, we are going to use the\nwhite screen.\nFirst of all it is more important to draw\nthe plates and we draw. So, if this is the\ncenter line let us say, we are going to draw\nx axis in this direction, y axis is in this\ndirection, this is h, the total thickness\nis 2h. So, the thickness width will be used\nwhen calculating the discharge. So, what we\nhave been given.\nGiven is, u of y can be written as, 3 u not\n/ 2 into 1 minus y / h whole square and width\nof plate is equal to b, this we have already\nbeen told. So, discharge Q is going to be,\nso, basically we have to integrate from minus\nh to h because this is 0 then this is minus\nh and this is plus h. 3 u not 2 we wil multiply,\nyou know, or let me first write down the,\nI mean, this formula, then we will put in\nthe values.\nSo, Q is equal to integral minus h to h u\nof y b dy. The discharge area into velocity.\nThis is velocity this area and integrated\nover from minus h to h or when we can, sorry,\nso, minus h to h then it becomes 3 u not / 2\nb into 1 minus y square / h square into dy.\nNow, we have to simply integrate it. So, Q\nis going to be, so, we will takeout whatever\nis constant, minus h to h 1 minus y square\n/ h square dy or Q is equal to 3 u not / 2\nb and after integrating it becomes y minus\nh to h minus 1 / h square y cube / 3 minus\nh to h and this will give 3 u not b h minus\nu not b h. So, Q will be 2.\nNow what we are going to do is we are going\nto the, so, we have to obtain a relationship\nfor the flow rate through the plates and which\nwe have got Q is equal to 2 u not b h for\nthe problem that was there.\nSo, we now proceed to the another concept\ncalled Stokes law. So, we have to, you know,\nif we consider the flow of viscous flow past\na sphere. So, this is the sphere and the,\nthe flow is, there is a flow of velocity V\ncoming to the sphere, the diameter of the\nsphere is D, mu is the kinematic fluid viscosity,\nthen we will, you know, see that when the\nReynolds number rho V D / mu is very small.\nWhen this happens, then the viscous forces\nare dominant over the initial forces. But\nwe already know that because Re is, in denominator\nwhat we have, inertial forces. So, if viscous\nforces will be dominant than inertial forces\nthen Reynolds's number will be less than 1.\nThis is very this, I mean, this can be seen\nfrom the equation as well. This is called\ncreeping flow.\nSo, now Stokes derived an equation for drag\nforce on the sphere in creeping flow. So,\nthe derivation of the Stokes, I mean, this\ndrag force is outside the scope. So, I am\nwhat I am going to give you is, I am going\nto give you directly the result. So, the drag\nforce on the sphere is given by 3 pi mu VD,\nI think, you should all should memorize it,\nout of which two-third of this, that is, 2\npi mu VD is due to viscous forces and 1 / 3rd\ncontribution is due to the pressure forces.\nSo, this is important.\nSo, after this we are going to calculate the\nterminal fall velocity. So, if there is a\nsphere, you know, there is when it falls through\na liquid, there is the weight acting and there\nis a drag force acting against its motion\ndirection. We are going to see how we arrived\nat the terminal fall velocity.\nSo, for the sake of easiness, I have put a\nfigure here, on the right side top corner,\nwhere you can see the sphere. So, what is\nterminal velocity? It is the maximum velocity\nthat can be attained by an object as it falls\nthrough a fluid. It occurs when the sum of\nthe drag force and the buoyant force on the\nparticle is equal to the weight of the particle.\nThe drag force and the buoyant force on the\nparticle is equal to the weight of the particle.\nBecause both drag force and buoyant force\nwill try to take it upward and weight will\ntry to bring it downward. Therefore, the net\nforce on this particular sphere or object\nis 0.\nThus, the object has 0 acceleration, as the\nobject falls with a constant speed, known\nas terminal velocity. This phenomenon is what\nresults in a sphere having a terminal velocity\nin a fluid. So, the weight of the particle\nis downwards, so, downward forces weight of\nthe fluid, weight of the particle and this\nis equal to density multiplied by volume is\nmass, and g is acceleration due to gravity.\nSo, weight is mass m g. For a sphere it is\npi D cube / 6 is the volume and rho is the\nparticle the whatever the sphere is made of.\nSo, I will just, so you do not have confusion,\nthis is the W.\nWhat is going to be the upward force? It is\nthe drag force and the force due to buoyancy.\nSo, let us say, F D is the drag force and\nF buoyancy is the buoyancy force. As we have\nalready seen 2 couple of slides back, Stokes\nderived, the drag force as 3 pi mu V D. And\nthe buoyancy force is the weight of the liquid\ndisplaced by that sphere. So, it will displace\nthe weight of the liquid that will be displaced\nwill be the volume of the sphere, but into\nthe density of liquid. That is what we have\nwritten, rho fluid and this is acceleration\ndue to gravity.\nSo, F D plus F buoyancy is 3 pi mu V D plus\npi D cube / 6 rho fluid into g. Now, for the\nequilibrium of this particle these 2 forces\nshould be balancing. So, F D this plus F buoyancy\nis equal to W for example.\nSo, from the equilibrium equation we can simply\nrearrange these, because V is the term that\nwe get from Drag Force equation \nand this is the terminal fall velocity. So,\nthis is an important equation D square / 18\nmu into rho particle minus rho fluid multiplied\nby the acceleration due to gravity g.\nNow, we will solve a problem. The question\nsays; determine the fall velocity of a 0.06\nmillimeters sand particle, its specific gravity\n2.65 in water. Take viscosity of water as\n10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second. This\nis as simple a problem as it can get. Here,\nyou are given the diameter of the particle,\nwe have given the gravity. Therefore, you\nknow, the density of the particle, water properties\nyou already know, which has actually viscosity\nbeen given already to you.\nIt is 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second.\nBy this time you need not have to be given\nthe viscosity of water all the time, you must\nhave an idea how much that viscosity is.\nSo, as all the other problems what we are\ngoing to do is, we are going to have a white\nsheet and start writing the things that are\ngiven first. So, we have been given D is equal\nto 0.06 meters or, sorry, millimeters or 0.06\ninto 10 to the power minus 3 meter, mu is\ngiven as 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second,\nrho of fluid is given as because it is water\nso, we can take 1000 kilogram per meter cube,\nrho particle will be S into rho fluid. So,\nS is given as 2.65 into 1000 and that gives\n2650 kilograms per meter cube.\nSo, we have to assume, let us assume that,\nfluid is creeping, that is, Reynolds number\nis very much, not very much but less than\n1. Therefore, terminal velocity V, as we have\nderived is written as D square / 18 mu rho\nparticle minus rho fluid / g and this 0.06\ninto 10 to the power minus 3 whole square\ndivided by 18 into 10 to the power minus 3\n2650 minus 1000 into 9.81.\nThis gives, V is equal to 3.23 into 10 to\nthe power minus 3 meters per second. So, this\nis an important value that we have got now,\nV. So, please note it down.\nBut we have to check if our assumption of\ncreeping flow is correct or not. So, for doing\nthat, what we can do is, in here in this slide\nitself, so, R e can be given as rho fluid\ninto V into D / mu. So, 1000 into 3.23 into\n10 to the power minus 3, D is 0.06 into 10\nto the power minus 3 divided by 10 to the\npower minus 3. So, this is 0.6. And this comes\napproximately to 0.19. So, our Reynolds's\nnumber is less than 1, therefore, it is creeping\nflow. So, our this is the terminal velocity.\nSo, we are going to go back to the slide.\nSo, this is the problem that we have solved.\nSo, we have got V is equal to 3.23 into 10\nto the power minus 3 meters per second and\nafter checking the Reynolds number it came\nout to be 0.19 which is less than 1, therefore,\ncreeping flow and we would have applied the\nterminal velocity.\nSo, we are now moving slowly to the phenomenon\nof turbulent flow. So, turbulent motion is\nan irregular motion which is associated with\na random fluctuation of swirling regions of\nfluid called eddies. These fluctuations are\ncaused due to disturbances like a roughness\nof solid surface. Suppose a fluid is moving\nand it counters a roughness a rough surface.\nSo, the fluctuations in the velocity will\nhappen, will arises, will be produced and\nthese are the causes of turbulent motion.\nIrregularities can be described by different\nlaws, one of which is law of probabilities.\nImportant to know is, when the Reynolds number\nof the flow is less than Reynolds number,\nwhich is a critical Reynolds number, for if\nyou remember, in the pipe flow it was 2300,\nthe kinetic energy of the flow cannot sustain\nthe random fluctuations and then this is called\nthe laminar flow. When Reynolds number is\nmore than the critical Reynolds number for\nexample, in pipe flow it was 4000 the kinetic\nenergy of the flow supports the growth of\nthe fluctuation.\nThis is a different way of seeing what a laminar\nand turbulent flow is or that is called transition\nto turbulence or turbulent. So, it no longer\nremains laminar. So, this is how the velocity,\nyou know, vectors or the eddies in the flow\nlooks like, these are turbulent flow.\nSo, when we talk about the turbulent flow\nthere is an important mention about Reynolds\nexperiment. So, Osborne Reynolds he verified\nthe existence of laminar and turbulent flow\nregimes by injecting dye streaks into the\nflow in a glass pipe. So, what he did was,\nhe introduced the dye tracer and dye was injected\nfrom here. And, you know, then there were\ncertain velocity the dye had a movement like\nthis because the fluid became colored. But\nwhen he increased the velocity the dye tracer\nstarted having the fluctuations like this,\nas you can see, and this was a clear indication\nof the existence of laminar and turbulent\nflow regimes.\nOne of the important composite, I mean, one\nof the important components of the turbulent\nflow is the Reynolds decomposition. What is\nthat? It is the decomposition of an instantaneous\nvalue of a hydrodynamic quantity into time-averaged\nvalue and its fluctuation. For example, we\nare going to describe, but just to tell you,\nif there is a velocity u an instantaneous\nvelocity, it can be broken up into 2 components;\naverage value plus whatever deviation it has\nfrom the average value and those deviations\nare called fluctuations.\nFor example, at any point in time, if you\nmeasure a velocity, let us say, 2 meters per\nsecond, and the average velocity of that flow\nis 1.8 meters per second, then the fluctuation\nis going to be 0.2 meters per second, this\nis just a very crude example. So, here we\nsee for the instantaneous velocity u, v and\nw and pressure P, u can be written as, u bar\nplus u dash. This is the average, bar denotes\naverage, prime denotes fluctuations. So, bar\ndenotes average values and prime which is\nthe like this denotes fluctuate, w is w bar\nplus w prime, p as p bar plus p prime.\nWhat are the time-averaged values? Time-averaged\nvalue is, if we start from beginning or time\nT is equal to 0 and integrate over t not plus\nT u dt and divid it by the whole time we get\nthe average time-averaged value. We have done\nthis previously when we were deriving the\nlaminar flow we have used time-averaged values.\nSo, suppose this is a turbulent flow this\none here So, I am going to use laser pointer.\nSo, this is turbulent, you know, like this\nand by calculation if we say that this is\nthe, the straight line here, is the u bar\nthen the deviation of at any point is called\nthe fluctuation. Therefore, u is u bar plus\nu prime. If we consider this point then the\nfluctuation is in the other direction. This\nis also the same, this is steady and this\nis unsteady, it is changing in time.\nSo, we are going to define some maths here.\nIf f dash and g dash are any two general fluctuating\nparameters, we have seen u prime, v prime,\nw prime and p prime then the following result\nholds true. So, if we take the average of\nthe fluctuating component it will be 0. If\nwe multiply both fluctuating component and\nthen take the average it will never be 0 it\nwill be non 0. Also, if we differentiate those\nfluctuating component or double differentiate\nit and take the average alone this will be\n0. And if we do the differential of multiplication\nof these 2 quantities, then it will never\nbe equal to 0. These are the Reynolds condition.\nSo, I think this is a nice place to stop before\nthe next lecture. We are going to start with\nshear stress in turbulent flow in the next\nclass. Thank you so much",
    "video_13": "Welcome back to this last lecture of turbulent\nflow and laminar flows where we are going\nto talk about turbulent flow in smooth pipes.\nLast time in the last lecture we had seen\nwhat a smooth and rough bed is based on the\nReynolds particle Reynolds number Re*. Now\nwe are going to continue over the turbulent\nflow in smooth pipes. So, if we refer to equation\n18.\nSo, what we had found out was u was u* by\nKappa ln y plus C. The equation 18, in this\nparticular lecture, I mean, in this particular\nweek’s lecture. From the above equation,\nthe velocity at the wall u at y is equal to\n0 will be minus infinity, correct. If we put\ny is equal to 0. So, if we put ln 0, it will\nbe minus infinity. u is positive at some distance\nfar away from the wall.\nHence, u is 0 at some finite distance y prime\nfrom the wall, that is, y at y prime is equal\nto 0. Hence, from equation 18, we can say\nthat at distance y prime C will be minus u\nstar by Kappa ln y prime. Because if we put\ny is equal to 0 it is going to be infinity.\nSo, this logarithmic profile does not fit\nthis. Therefore, we assume that u is 0 at\nsome finite distance y dash y prime from the\nwall. And if you say the equation was this\none, we assume there was u is 0 u star by\nKappa ln and we say at this y prime it is\n0 plus C. Therefore, C will be minus u star\nby Kappa 1n y prime.\nTherefore, this is what we get, the same thing.\nNow, if we use this above equation in equation\n18 and substitute Kappa is equal to 0.4 we\nwill get u is equal to 2.4 u star 1n y by\ny dash, where y dash is the point above the\nbed where the velocity is 0 and this is equation\nnumber 22.\nNow, this equation number 22, can be expressed\nin terms of common logarithm as, so, what\nwe have done? We have done, converted ln into\nlog, because the previous equation was in\nterms of natural log. We have converted into\n10 log base 2 to the power 10 and we get 5.75\nlog 10 y by y prime. Now, again from the Nikuradse’s\nexperiment, y prime actually has been found\nout to be delta prime, where this is a thickness\nof the laminar sublayer viscous sublayer by\nhundred and seven.\nTherefore, delta bar can be written as, because\nthis, I mean, this has been defined, not in\nthis course but we know that delta prime is\n11.6 nu by u star.\nTherefore, we can write, so, if we use this\nand put it into this equation; we can write\ny prime is 0.108 nu by u star, just simple\nsubstitution. And now, we can simply obtain,\nif we use this in equation number 18 or this\nparticular equation, equation number 23, then\nwe obtain u by u star is equal to 5.75 log\n10 u star y by nu plus 5.55, very simple.\nNow, this as you see, the velocity distribution\nfor turbulent flow in smooth pipe. This is\nthe velocity distribution for turbulent flow\nin a smooth pipe, where there is no irregularity.\nNow, what about the turbulent flow? So, it\nis better to note down this equation. Now,\nwe have to see equation 23. So, actually this\nu by u star is equal to 5.75 log 10 y by y\nprime is valid for rough surface as well because\nall the approximation that we did was on this\ny dash. For rough pipes Nikuradse obtained\nthe value of y prime as k/30. This is obtained\nby Nikuradse and if you substitute this y\nprime in equation number 23 this one,\nWe can obtain, u by u star is equal to 5.75\nlog to the base 10 y divided by k/30 or if\nyou take this 30 out, it is u by u star is\nequal to 5.75 log to the base 10 y by k plus\n8.5. Now, you see, this is the velocity distribution\nof turbulent flow in rough pipes. These coefficients\nare little different this k is different,\nmore importantly, it also has some sort of\nlogarithmic form, both smooth and the rough.\nNow, it is a good idea to solve one problem\nhere, on this particular concept, and the\nsolving the problem will give more understanding\nnow. You know, the question is, determine\nthe average height of roughness for a rough\npipe of diameter 10 centimeter when the velocity\nat point 4 centimeter away from the wall is\n40 percent more than the velocity at a point\n1 centimeter from the wall. So, diameter it\nsays is 10 centimeter, when the velocity at\na point 4 centimeter away is 40 percent more\nthan the velocity at a point 1 centimeter\naway from the wall.\nSo, what we are going to do? We are going\nto assume our white screen back again and\nstart solving by writing down what are given.\nGiven is, D is equal to 10 centimeters or\n10 into 10 to the power minus 2 meters or\n0.1 meter. It is given, u at y is equal to\n4 centimeters or 4 is equal to 1.4 times u\nat y is equal to 1 and the surface is rough.\nThis is what we have already been told. We\ncan therefore, from our equations we can write,\nu at y is equal to 4 by u star can be written\nas, 1.4 u at y is equal to 1 divided by u\nstar. So, what we do? We write this, so, we\nwrite on the left hand side, 5.75 log base\n10, 4 by k, because it is rough, plus 8.5\nis equal to 1.4 times 5.75 log base 10 kappa\nplus 8.5.\nThis is what is given, I mean, this is what\nwe have know. So, we can write, this will\nremain as it is, 5.75 log base 10. So, log\n4 by k plus 8.5 is equal to this, if you multiply\nit becomes 8.05 log base 10 one by kappa plus\n11.9. So, we will split this log10, log4,\nI mean, log. So, we can write it, 5.75 log\n4 plus 5.75log base 1 by k + 8.5 is equal\nto we can write 8.05 log 1 by k plus 11.9.\nAnd this you see, there is 1 by log 1 by k,\nhere, log 1 by k here, and if you take it\nto the other side, I am going to use.\nSo, we are going to bring it on the other\nside, 5.75 log 1 by k base 10 minus 8.05 log\nbase 10 1/k is equal to 11.9 minus 8.5 minus\n5.75 log base 10 4. So, this will become,\nthe left hand side will become, minus 2.3\nlog 1 by k is equal to minus 0.062. And therefore,\nlog 1 by k is equal to 0.027, which implies,\n1 by k is equal to 1.064 per centimeter, which\nimplies, k is equal to 0.9399 centimeter.\nSo, this was what was asked. So, k is coming\nout to be 0.9399 centimeter. This is the answer\nand how to solve? We have already done that\nin the sheet.\nNow, we are going to talk about turbulent\nvelocity distribution in terms of average\nvelocity. So, there is a flow and there is\nan elementary circular ring here, as you can\nsee, this is of radius R. So, we have an elementary\ncircular ring of radius r and thickness dr\nwhich we have considered. So, radius small\nr and thickness dr, that is, what we have\nconsidered.\nDischarge Q is given by integral 0 to R u\ninto 2 pi r dr. Now, can we calculate it for\nsmooth pipes? Yes, since, y is equal to R\nminus, capital R minus small r, we can write,\nequation 24, you know, if you do not remember\nthe equation 24, I will take you to equation\n24. So, this was equation 24. Equation 24,\nu by u star can be written as 5.75 log 10\nu star R minus r by nu plus 5.55 and that\nwe have to substitute in Q.\nOr we can also write, u is equal to 5.75 log\nbase 10 u star R minus r by nu plus 5.55 y\ninto u star. So, what we did? We took u star\nthat side. Now, if you substitute this equation\n27 in equation number 26, so, it will become\nintegral to 0 to R so u this is u into 2 pi\nr dr, very simple. Also we can write, V average\nis Q by pi R square. So, we can directly go\nfor the average velocity.\nIf we integrate this equation number 28 and\nusing the results in equation 29, that is,\ndividing by pi R square for obtaining V average,\nwe can get, V average by u star is 5.75 log\nto the base 10 u star R by nu plus 1.75. My\nrequest to you is that you please try to integrate\nthis equation, it is very simple, it is class\n12th 11th and 12th Mathematics. But you please\nintegrate and try to obtain the equation number\n30.\nNow, for rough pipes similarly, we will use\nthe equation that we have got for the rough\npipes and we use the still the same y is capital\nR because we are calculating the distance\nfrom the wall capital R minus small r. So,\nwe are going to get u, we have this equation\nthat we have derived equation number 25, that\nwas, R minus small r, so, instead of, y by\nR, y by k we have, R minus small r by k.\nOr we took u star that side and substituted\nthis u in the equation for Q. So, we integrate\nit from 0 to R, this is u into 2 pi r dr and\nusing the equation 32, we will get a similar\nequation V average by u star is equal to 5.75\nlog to the base 10 R by k plus 4.75.\nSo, what is this? This is the average velocity\ndivided by the frictional velocity for the\nturbulent pipe flow case.\nNow, the difference of the velocity at any\npoint and the average velocity for smooth\npipes. For smooth pipes, we have seen that\nthe u by u star we had, we came, we derived\nthis equation, correct. And we also just now\nwe saw that V average by u star is going is\nthis equation and therefore, from the above\nequation we can simply subtract these two\nequation and we are able to find u minus V\naverage by u star. So, we do this equation,\nthis minus this, this minus this. So, it will\nbe u star is common, so, it will be u minus\nV average by u star is equal to 5.75 log to\nthe base 10 u star y by nu u star R by nu.\nSo, nu and nu can get cancelled, it will be\ny by R or we can say, u minus V average by\nu star is equal to 5.75 log y by R plus 3.75.\nSo, this is an important equation again. So,\nall these you either you remember or you can\nactually derive it. It is very simple, starting\nfrom the, starting from the basic logarithmic\nvelocity profile.\nNow, we did it for smooth pipes. Now, for\nrough pipes, we have an equation and we also\nobtained V average by u star. We do the same\nprocedure, we subtract this equation, we subtract\nthis equation from this equation. So, this\nminus this and utilizing the above equation,\nwe get u minus V average by u star. So, we\nhave got y by k divided by R by k plus 8.5\nminus 4.75\nOr we can simply get u minus V average by\nu star is equal to 5.75 log to the base 10\ny by R plus 3.75. Is there any observation?\nIf you see for either for smooth or for rough\nthis difference came out to be the same. So,\nthe observation is the difference of velocity\nat any point and average velocity is same\nfor both smooth and rough pipes. This is important\nto know that.\nNow, about the power law velocity profile,\na little bit on that. So, the power law velocity\nprofile for smooth pipes can be expressed\nas, it is, u by u max can be written as y\nby R to the power 1 by n. This is the power\nlaw velocity that was given or we can always\nwrite in terms of R because y is, y is R minus\nsmall r and that you substitute here, you\nwill end up in this equation. So, this 1/n\ndepends upon the Reynolds number, putting\nn is equal to 7 in above equation gives one-seventh\npower law velocity profile. This is one of\nthe very famous velocity profiles.\nThe value of n will increase with increasing\nReynolds number. Power law velocity profiles\ncannot give 0 slope at the pipe center. So,\npower law of velocity profiles also cannot\ncalculate the wall shear stress. Why? Because\nthe power law profiles gives a velocity gradient\nof infinity at the walls. That you can try,\nby substituting r is equal to, small r is\nequal to capital R. You can check it check\nit at.\nNow, we are going to solve one of the problems.\nSo, the velocity profile for incompressible\nturbulent fluid in a pipe of radius R is given\nby u of r as u max into 1 minus r by R to\nthe power 1 by 7. Obtain an expression for\nthe average velocity in the pipe. Hear by\nchance, or by, you know, you get 1 by 7 power\nlaw. So, how to attack this type of problems\nand actually you can be given any such profile\nand you should follow the same procedure as\nI am going to do now, so that, you are able\nto calculate the average velocity in the pipe.\nSo, how to do that? We simply go to white\nscreen.\nAnd we write given, u of r is given as u max\ninto 1 minus r by R to the power 1 by 7. So,\nthe average velocity profile will be simply\n1 pi divided by the entire area 0 to R u r\n2 pi r dr or we can write, 1 by pi R square\nintegral 0 to R u max into 1 minus r by R\nto the power 1 by 7 2 pi r dr. Therefore,\nwe can take out u max outside and we can also\ntake 2 pi also outside.\nSo, this pi, pi gets cancelled, 2 comes out,\nso, it became 2 u max by R square because\npi gets cancelled integral 0 to R 1 minus\nr by R to the power 7 r dr or what we can\ndo is, V bar is 2 u max integral 0 to R, we\nwill keep this one as 1 by 7, and we can write\nr by R and d r by R and call it one. Let,\n1 minus r by R as x, this means, dx is equal\nto minus d r by R. And so, if we substitute\nthis, in this equation, what we can do? I\nwill start from,\nSo, using the, we write V bar is equal to\n2 u max integral x to the power 1 by 7 one\nminus x minus dx. So, that is from 1 to 0.\nSo, it will be 2 u max integral 0 to 1 x to\nthe power 1 by 7 x minus 1 dx or 2 u max x\nto the power 8 by 7 minus x to the power 7\ndx, that is, 1 to 0. These limits have to\nbe checked 1 to 0. So, it was 1 to 0, 1 to\n0, 1 to 0.\nSo, V prime can be 2 u max into 7/15 x to\nthe power 15 by 7 minus 7/8 x to the power\n8/7, the limits from 1 to 0 for both side.\nSo, V bar is 2 u max and we substitute one\nas 1 and one as 0. So, it will be 7 by 8 minus\n7/15. So, V bar will be written by 2 u max\ninto, just copying the same thing from the\nlast line, 7/15 and V bar is going to be 0.816\nu max. So, this is actually a general way\nto calculate the average velocity. So, does\nnot matter what the profile is, this is how\nyou are going to proceed. So, an expression\nI will write it down here as well is 0.816\nu max .\nSo, these are the references, as I have already\nshown you in the book, I mean, also in the\nintroduction slides. And so, this week’s\nlecture on the laminar and turbulent flow\nis finished. I will see you next week with\nanother set of lectures on hydraulic engineering.\nThank you so much. Have a nice weekend. ",
    "video_14": "Hello, everyone. So, this week we are going\nto study about the boundary layer theory.\nThis is the week 4 of hydraulic engineering\ncourse. So, we are going to go to straight\nto the slides now.\nSo, when a real fluid flows past a solid,\nthe fluid particles stick to the solid surface.\nSo, that is one of the phenomena that happens.\nAnd the velocity of the fluid particles close\nto the solid boundary is actually equal to\nthe velocity of the boundary and this phenomenon\nis called the no slip boundary condition.\nFor a stationary body, the fluid velocity\nat the boundaries going to be zero because\nas we said in this point above that the velocity\nof the fluid particles close to the solid\nboundary is equal to the velocity of the boundary.\nSo, if the boundary is stationary then the\nfluid velocity at the boundary is going to\nbe zero. So, actually this is the most commonly\nused no slip boundary condition that we use\nin a viscous fluid flow. What is viscous fluid\nflow? A small detail which we have already\ntalked about before but will look into more\ndetails in the upcoming lectures in coming\nweeks.\nSo, what happens is, far away from the boundary,\nthe velocity of the fluid is actually higher.\nAnd the velocity increases from zero value\non the stationary surface to free-stream of\nthe velocity, free stream velocity of the\nfluid in the direction normal to the boundary.\nSo, if this is the case that happens when\nthe surface is stationary. If it is moving\nthen the velocity at the boundary is going\nto be the velocity of the surface that it\nis on.\nSo, because of this phenomenon what happens\nis there is a velocity variation and this\ngives a velocity gradient du / dy which exist\nin normal direction. So, in case of say, for\nexample, this is the boundary because of no\nslip and this is stationary \nand suppose there has been a velocity coming\nin, so, we are not going to talk about let\nus say, in between now but we say, suppose\nhere is a velocity u and this distance is\ny and, of course, because this is stationary\nat this point, the velocity is going to be\nzero. So, the velocity gradient \nto be du / dy.\nThis velocity variation occurs in a very thin\nregion of flow near the solid surface. So,\nfar away from the solid boundary the velocity\nis going to be the velocity with which the\nflow was actually coming. So, this whole phenomenon\noccurs in a very thin region and this layer,\nthis thin region is called the boundary layer.\nThis is the diagram which has been adopted\nfrom S. K., Som’s book of Fluid Mechanics\nintroduction to Fluid Mechanics and Fluid\nMachines.\nSo, what happens is, if there is a flow that\nhas suppose the velocity u that is coming\nand there is a flat plate of length L here,\nwhat happens is, when it encounters there\nstarts developing a thin region. So, I will\nshow you, so, this is the thin region and\nabove this thin region the velocity will remain\nu, but below that the velocity will start\nvarying. It goes from zero at this point to\nsay, for example, u at this point and this\nis the existence of the velocity gradient,\nthis where the velocity gradient is going\nto exist.\nNot saying it is going to be constant du / dy\nbut there exists a non zero velocity gradient\nand this thickness we are going to talk about\nit later. This is at any distance, this is\nthe boundary layer thickness.\nSo, Prandtl actually divided the flow of the\nfluid in the neighbourhood of the solid boundary\ninto 2 regions, to have a more simplified\nlook. So, one is called the boundary layer.\nSo, it is in the immediate vicinity of the\nsolid boundary where the viscous forces and\nrotationality cannot be ignored. So, there\nare 2 things that cannot be ignored in the\nboundary layer, the viscous forces and the\nphenomenon of rotationality. We have seen\nin the previous lectures that most of the\nflow in the water is considered irrotational.\nWe are going to explore that into more detail,\nwhen we study the viscous fluid flow. So,\nas I said in the boundary layer, these are\nthe things that cannot be ignored and in this\nregion there will be a velocity gradient equal\nto du / dy. And therefore, the fluid will\nexert a shear stress tau on the wall which\nwe assume to be equal to mu du / dy, where\nmu is the eddy viscosity.\nThen the second region is called the outer\nflow region. The velocity is constant here\nand is equal to the free stream velocity.\nAs I told you in the initial slides that above\nthis boundary layer the velocity will not\nbe effected, it will be the same as this free\nstream velocity that was the flow was coming\nwith whatever velocity it had before the same\nwill be maintained above this boundary layer.\nSo, all the phenomenon that is happening is\nin this boundary layer. Boundary layer is\na very, very important phenomenon actually\nin oceans or rivers. All the phenomenon, such\nas, the sediment transport or the transport\nof phytoplanktons, Norway is it occurs in\nthis particular region, that is, called the\nboundary layer. However, above that, that\nis, outer flow region and the velocity remains\nunaffected.\nSo, in this there is no viscous forces that\nwe consider, and the flow is essentially irrotational.\nAnd therefore, the potential flow techniques\nmay be utilized to obtain the velocity field.\nSo, we have talked about potential flow in\nthe previous slide, in the previous lecture,\nwhere we studied about the streamlines and\nthe potential flow in a topic called fluid\nkinematics. So, this figure has been taken\nfrom Cengel, the name of the book is Fluid\nMechanics: Fundamentals and Applications from\nMcGraw-Hill Higher Education.\nHere, it shows, that the flow is coming with\na velocity V and there is a plate here, you\nsee, this is the plate and if the flow will\npassed over it, this region, that is, enclosing\nthe flat plate is actually boundary layer,\nas indicated here, and the flow here is rotational,\nas we have seen, and with some finite viscous\nforces. So, viscous forces will exist in this\nregion and the region outside is outer flow\nwhere the flow is inviscid or there is no\nviscosity or friction and we can consider\nirrotational region of the flow here.\nNow, after this brief introduction, we will\ntalk about how the boundary layer grows over\na flat plate. This is the most simplified\nobject that you think of is a flat plate above\nwhen the flow will passed over it how the\nboundary layer will grow above that. So, to\ndo that we have to consider the flow of the\nfluid having free stream velocity U and that\nhappens over a smooth flat stationary plate\nplaced parallel to the direction of the free\nstream. So, something like this.\nSo, I will explain the terminology here. This\nis the velocity, the free stream velocity\nwhere the flow is coming, this is a velocity\nU and it encounters a plate here. So, this\nis the plate. I will take away the ink now.\nAnd the because the flow will strike the plate\nhere first, that is, called the leading edge\nand this is point A. So, after that I will\ncome to see why this is laminar zone, why\nthis is transition zone, why this is turbulence\nzone, but just to show you in the diagram.\nSo, the first few, I mean, units over the\nflat plate is going to be laminar, that is,\nthe laminar zone. After which this the flow\nin this region is going to be a transitional\nzone and after that, this is a turbulent zone\nwhere the entire flow will become turbulent.\nSo, now we have put the drawing here. So,\nthat will be of help when we start writing\nsome of the equations. So, as I told you before,\nthe velocity of the fluid on the plate surface\nis zero because of no slip condition, as the\nplate is stationary. But at some distance\naway from the plate the fluid is having certain\nvelocity, that velocity we do not know for\nnow. But at some distance away, suppose this\ndistance, for example, that is, away from\nthe plate, by this much, it will have certain\nvelocity.\nTherefore, because of existence of this velocity,\na velocity gradient is setup. This is X direction,\nlet us say, this is Y direction. And this\nvelocity gradient results into shear stress\nbecause for existence of shear stress. Shear\nstress is proportional to du / dy, the rate\nof change of velocity with the distance normal\nto the flow.\nNow, the presence of this shear stress, what\nit does is, it retards the fluid motion in\nthe vicinity of the plate. So, this, I mean,\nin the existence of the velocity gradient\nwill induce shear stress and that is going\nto slow down the fluid motion near the plate.\nAnd the boundary region therefore, will start\noccurring at the leading edge because that\nis the first point where the velocity is zero.\nAnd, as soon as, we go over and above it there\nwill be certain velocity.\nSo, that is the first point. Before that any\npoint will have the velocity U. The boundary\nlayer grows with downstream distance from\nthe leading edge x. So, this is the direction\nx. So, as soon as, we start moving in the\nx direction, the boundary layer will keep\non growing in thickness. So say, let us say,\nthis is delta, that is, the boundary layer\nthickness, at any distance x.\nSo, one of the important parameters that you\nhave read in the fluid flow is Reynolds number.\nSo, there is going to be a Reynolds number\nassociated with this type of phenomenon. That\nis the occurrence of or the development of\nthe boundary layer which is given by, as given\nhere, R e at a distance x, is given by, Ux\n/ nu. Where u is the free stream velocity\nhere, x is the distance from the plate, a\nleading edge \nand nu is the kinematics viscosity of fluid.\nNow, what is laminar boundary layer? We are\ngoing to continue, this is the laminar zone,\nso we are going to concentrate on that. Near\nthe leading edge of the plate the flow in\nthe boundary layer is laminar. This is important\nto note. And the length of the plate from\nthe leading edge to the point upto which laminar\nboundary layer exists is called laminar zone.\nSo, this is the leading edge here. So, the\nlength of the plate from the leading edge,\nto the point, where the laminar boundary layers,\nso here, the laminar boundary layer is existing\nuntil this point, as indicated in this diagram.\nSo, this distance is called the laminar zone,\nthis one here.\nSo, for a flat plate it has been found out\nthat the laminar boundary layer occurs up\nto Reynolds number of 5 into 10 to the power\n5. Lot of people have done research, experimental\nresults confirmed by numerical analysis and\nthis value has come up. So, if the Reynolds\nnumber is less than 5 into 10 to the power\n5 for a flow over a plate the laminar boundary\nlayer will occur up to that particular point.\nAnd then there is a turbulent boundary layer\nhere, a little bit information on that. Actually\nwith increasing x as we have seen, Reynolds\nnumber as x increases.\nAs we saw that Reynolds number as a function\nof x for ux / nu and x is in this directions.\nSo, as you keep on moving in this direction,\nx is going to increase and therefore, the\nReynolds number will increase. Now, when the\nReynolds number increases to more than 5 into\n10 to the power 5 the laminar boundary layer\nbecomes unstable. Unstable means, the velocity\nwill have some fluctuations.\nAnd then there is a transition from laminar\nto turbulent boundary layer. So, this is the\ntransitional zone here. So, this short length\nover which the laminar boundary layer changes\nto turbulent is called the transition zone,\nindicated by this distance here. Now, the\ndownstream of the transition zone, the boundary\nlayer becomes turbulent because x keeps on\nincreasing \nand therefore, Reynolds number increases leading\nto fully turbulent region.\nNow, as you see in this diagram, there is\nsomething called laminar sub-layer. And what\nis that laminar sub-layer? This is a region\nwhere the turbulent boundary layer zone and\nit is very close to the solid boundary. So,\nbasically it is a region in the turbulent\nboundary layer zone. So, this is this does\nnot happen here, but it happens in the turbulent\nboundary layer and it occurs very close to\nthe solid boundary and here, because viscosity\nwill play an important role.\nTherefore, the viscous effects are dominant;\nthey are much more than the other type of\nforces. Since, the thickness of this layer,\nas we can see, this is very, very small compared\nto this, the variation of the velocity can\nbe assumed to be linear. So, in laminar sub-layer\nvelocity profile is assumed linear. Linear\nwith respect to what? With the distance increasing\ndistance linear, that means, with increasing\ny. \nAnd we also assume that there is has a constant\nvelocity gradient. So, the velocity gradient\ndu / dy is constant.\nTherefore, for linear variation of velocity,\nwe can write, du / dy is equal to u / y. Now,\nthe shear stress in this layer is constant\nand is equal to the boundary shear stress\ngiven by tao not, as we have already been\nusing not for the tau not, for the shear stress\nnear the wall this is also is it is like a\nsort of a wall only this is the boundary.\nAnd therefore, we can write tau not is equal\nto mu du / dy at y is equal to zero or using\nthis equation we can write mu u / y.\nNow, we will talk about another phenomenon,\nthat is, distortion of a fluid particle within\nthe boundary layer. What happens? So, this\nfigure has been taken from Munson Young and\nOkiishi’s Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics\npublished by Wiley and Sons. So, let me just,\nso, what it says is that the fluid particle\nretains its original shape in the uniform\nflow outside the boundary layer. That is very\ntrue, because outside the boundary layer there\nare no effects and the fluid particle, this\nis the fluid particle above the boundary layer,\nthis is the fluid particle that is going to\nbe in the boundary layer.\nSo, when it moves in this direction, there\nis no problem at all because all the points\nwill have equal velocities. However, this\nparticle here, after entering the boundary\nlayer the particles begin to distort, as you\ncan see. This is where it starts distorting\nand when it goes it distorts more, it distorts\nmore, depending upon what the velocity gradient\nbut there is definitely is a distortion from\nthis point to this point, as soon as it enters\nthe boundary layer.\nSo, the why this distortion occurs? This distortion\noccurs due to the velocity gradient inside\nthe boundary layer. How? Because the top of\nthe particle has a larger velocity then its\nbottom. So, this point here, the bottom will\nhave lesser velocity than at the top because\nthis is more closer to the solid surface the\nlower, the surface which is closer to the\nsolid surface here.\nTherefore, the flow inside the boundary layer\nhas a non zero vorticity. Because what does\nvorticity causes? It causes rotation and this\nis what we see, the fluid particle will rotate.\nAnd this happens because of the differential\nvelocity at the top and the bottom surface.\nAnd what we can see is, in the turbulent boundary\nlayer the particle becomes greatly distorted.\nSo, in the boundary layer the flow is rotational.\nNow, we are going to see, what the boundary\nlayer thickness is. In real sense, physically,\nthere is no sharp edge to the boundary layer.\nNow, the boundary layer thickness is the distance\nfrom the plate at which the fluid velocity\nis within some arbitrary value of the free\nstream velocity. So, this is an important\nterm, boundary layer thickness delta. We have\nseen similar term in some slides before. And\nwhat is this boundary layer thickness? It\nis distance from the plate, the flat plate\nover which we have considered the flow.\nSo, distance from the plate at which the fluid\nvelocity is within some arbitrary value of\nthe free stream velocity. Ideally, at the\ntop of this boundary layer, the velocity should\nbe equal to the free stream velocity, normally,\nat the top. So, this is the boundary layer.\nSo, because of this is the velocity is going\nto be zero and at one point we have to consider\nwhere the boundary layer. And so we assume,\nwhen the velocity reaches almost 99% of free\nstream velocity, the boundary layers cease\nto exist above that. And that thickness is\ncalled the boundary layer thickness.\nSo, what is so special about 0.99? Why not\nfor 0.96 or 0.98? To remove this confusion,\nwe will now look at some of the definitions.\nSome of the definitions is displacement thickness,\ngiven by, delta star, very important term,\nin this particular module of hydraulic engineering.\nThis is another thing called momentum thickness\nthat is called theta. And then there is something\ncalled energy thickness which is given by,\ndelta double star. So, these 3 are very important\nterms in boundary layer analysis.\nSo, we consider 2 velocity profiles for flow\npast a flat plate. So, this is flat plate\nhere. This is the 1 velocity profile, this\nis 2 and both has equal areas. And this figure\nhas been taken from Munson, Young and Okiishi\nFundamentals of Fluid Mechanics. So, as you\ncan see, I will explain these terms, as it\ncomes. So, this is a uniform profile, where\nmu is zero. So, there is no viscosity and\nthere is going to be slip at the wall, this\nplace.\nIt is not, I mean, here, there will be no\nslip condition. The second is the boundary\nlayer profile, this was a uniform profile\nand this \nis the boundary layer profile. Here, there\nwill be some viscosity and mu is not equal\nto zero and there is going to be no slip at\nthe wall. No slip at the wall means, the fluid\nvelocity just above the plate is going to\nhave the same velocity as the plate. In this\ncase, since, the plate is stationary, the\nfluid particle just above this, will have\na zero velocity.\nSo, that is why, the velocity profile, you\nsee, it is zero here. In profile, in the uniform\nprofile, at the beginning there exist some,\nthe u is here, there is the uniform velocity\nu, it is not zero.\nSo, within the boundary layer there is a velocity\ndeficit. So, this is the boundary layer. So,\nU capital U is the uniform velocity profile,\nhere also the free stream velocity is same.\nBut say, at this distance if the velocity\nis u, then the deficit of the velocity that\nis, happening is U minus u. u here, is the\nvelocity at a point in the boundary layer.\nSo, this is the velocity deficit equal to.\nBecause of this deficit, the flow rate across\nthe section b - b. So, this is the section\nb – b. I am going to remove. Sorry.\nSo, because of this deficit, the flow rate\nacross the section b - b is less than the\nflow rate across section a – a, that is,\ncorrect. Because the velocity here is limited,\nI mean, less than this U / u. So, the velocity\nin the boundary layer is lesser than the uniform\nvelocity profile by U minus u. Suppose what\nhappens, if the plate, my question to you\nis, what happens if the plate is displaced\nat section a - a by an amount delta dash?\nSo, here, this delta dash is called the displacement\nthickness. With this we will see in the upcoming\nlecture.\nSo, the question at which we are going to\nend this lecture today is, what happens if\nthe plate is displaced at section a - a by\nan amount delta dash. So, this is enough for\ntoday and we are going to start the next lecture\nby answering this question. Thank you so much.\nSee you in the next lecture. Bye.",
    "video_15": "Welcome back to the second lecture of this\nmodule, boundary layer analysis. So, last\nclass we finished the lecture by saying, what\nhappens if the plate is displaced at a section\na - a by an amount delta dash. So, we displace\nthis plate to here, for example.\nSo, to answer that, we see that the flow rate\nacross each section will be the same because\nthe area is the same. But in this section\nb – b, due to the deficit U - u, the momentum\nflux across the section b - b is also less\nthan that across this section a – a, true,\nbecause the velocity is different, it is a\ndeficit of U – u. And therefore, the momentum\nthickness theta is defined in terms of the\nmomentum flux. So, we saw the boundary layer\nthickness.\nWe saw the \ndisplacement thickness, the phenomenon. And\nwe saw what a momentum thickness is.\nNow, what we are going to do is, we are going\nto derive the displacement thickness. First,\nthe definition, displacement thickness is\nthe distance by which a streamline, just outside\nthe boundary layer, is displaced away from\nthe wall due to viscous effects on the plate,\nas we have seen in the last slide and answer\nto the question, which we started the lecture\nwith. So, displacement thickness is the distance\nby which a streamline, which is just outside\nthe boundary layer, is displaced away from\nthe wall due to the viscous effects on the\nplate.\nThis is the boundary layer. Again, look at\nthe definition, distance by which a streamline,\njust outside the boundary layer is, displaced\naway from the wall due to the viscous effects\non the plate. What exactly is that thickness?\nDelta dash x. This is the outer flow stream\nline, and this is the boundary layer, and\nthe velocity we was coming here, outside the\nboundary layer as you can see, the velocity\nis exactly U as a function of x is V.\nNow, we consider the flow over a smooth flat\nplate, like this. So, there is a flow which\nis coming with a speed U, there is a flat\nplate and at any distance x, there is a section\n1 - 1. I will remove this, but just to mark,\nthis is the section 1 – 1 and, that is,\nlocated at a distance x, from the leading\nedge. So, this is the leading edge. The orientation\nis clear to you, I hope. Now, at section 1\n- 1, we consider an elemental strip of thickness\ndy. Now, this dy so, this is the elemental\nthickness dy and it is located at a distance\ny from the plate. Again so, this is the elemental\nstrip of thickness dy.\nSuppose, if b is the width of the plate, that\nis, the width, then the area of the strip\ncan be given by, b into dy. The strip will\nhave the height dy and the width is b. Therefore,\nthe area is simply bdy, here. Now, the mass\nflux through the elemental strip is given\nby, rho u into dA. Rho u is the sort of a\nmomentum, rho into u, mass into velocity.\nOf course, we have not considered the volume,\nright now, but we multiply it with dA, to\nhave the mass flux. So, dA if you put dy,\nthis becomes rho U b into dy.\nWhereas, for the uniform velocity profile,\nso, the uniform velocity profile that exists\nin a region below this, the mass flux is given\nby, rho into U, because this is the full velocity\nU. Here, it is u as a function of distance\ny, this one, so, here is rho U b into dy,\nif there was the flow was uniform, and there\nwas no plate, for example, and if you would\nhave considered the same elemental area of\nthickness dy.\nTherefore, the reduction in the mass flux\nthrough the elemental strip, compared to the,\nyou know, uniform velocity profile will be\nthe difference of the mass fluxes. This is\ndue to uniform, that is, in the boundary layer,\nor if we take rho outside, b and dy outside,\nit becomes rho into U minus u into bdy.\nNow, the total reduction in mass flux through\nBC, will be, we have considered and its thickness\nof dy. So, what we are going to do? We are\ngoing to simply integrate over this length.\nAnd let us say, this is so, let me, so, this\ndistance is delta. So, the integration goes\nfrom 0 to delta and rho U - u b dy, that is,\nthe total reduction in mass flux through BC.\nI hope, this is clear, this is equation number\n1.\nNow, when the plate is displaced by delta\ndash, such that, the velocity at delta dash\nis equal to U, then the reduction in mass\nflux through the distance delta dash is going\nto be, very simple. It is going to be rho\nU because the velocity there is, U delta dash\ninto b. So, we have assumed, that the place,\nI mean, the plate is displaced by delta dash,\nsuch that, the velocity at delta dash is equal\nto the uniform velocity U, that was, outside\nthe boundary layer, then the reduction in\nthe mass flux through that distance is going\nto be rho U delta dash b, because at the plate\nit was 0.\nAnd this should be equal to the reduction\nin the mass flux through the \nboundary layer thickness, for example, at\nthat particular point at a distance x. So,\nrho U delta dash b is equal to integral 0\nto delta rho U - u b dy.\nThus, for an incompressible fluid, we obtain,\ndelta dash is equal to, what we do is, we\ntake these terms. So, we take rho U and b\ndown here, as a denominator and we simply\nwrite delta dash is equal to integral 0 to\ndelta 1 minus u / U into dy and this is the\nequation for the displacement thickness. So,\nin the numerical, when you get, you are going\nto use this, I mean, in this equation for\nthe, for finding the displacement thickness\ndelta dash.\nNow, proceeding, what is the momentum thickness\ntheta? So, momentum thickness theta is the\nloss of momentum flux in the boundary layer,\nas compared to that of the potential flow.\nSo, there is some loss in the momentum flux.\nAnd why that is lost? Because of the presence\nof the viscosity due to the presence of the\nplate in a viscous fluid flow. Therefore,\nthis is the loss of the momentum flux.\nNow, the deficit in the momentum flux for\nthe boundary layer flow is written as, the\nsame fundamental. Now, instead of, mass flux\nwe have written momentum flux. Therefore,\ninstead of, simply rho b U minus u, there\nis a multiplication term of a u as well, here.\nSo, this is the loss in the, the deficit in\nthe momentum flux, given by, equation number\n3.\nNow, the equation number 3 must be equal to\nthe momentum flux in the layer of uniform\nspeed U and thickness theta. That is how we\nderive the displacement thickness as well.\nSo, we equate rho b U square theta because\nthis is the momentum flux in a layer of uniform\nspeed U and thickness theta, or if we take\nthis down here, as a denominator, rho b, rho\nb will get cancelled, this will become u / U\ninto 1- u / U dy. So, this is the momentum\nthickness.\nNow, there is something called energy thickness,\ndelta double dash. We are not going to derive\nit. But some authors define, another thickness\nof the boundary layer, based on, the reduction\nof the kinetic energy of the fluid flow due\nto the velocity defect. So, the \nmomentum thickness was due to the loss of\nthe momentum flux, displacement was due to\nthe loss of the mass flux and the energy thickness\nreduction of the kinetic energy of the fluid\ndue to the velocity deficit. And we will just\nwrite down the equation here.\nIt is given as, integral of 0 to delta u / U\ninto 1- u square / U square, this is the free\nstream velocity, into dy.\nNow, we have to make note of some important\npoint, that is, the boundary layer theory\nis based on the fact that the boundary layer\nis thin. So, at any location, at any location\nx, this x must be very much greater than delta,\nboundary layer thickness and also the displacement\nthickness. This x must also be greater than\nmomentum thickness and also the energy thickness.\nThis is these four things, means that, the\nboundary layer is thin. Boundary layer thickness,\ndelta is a function of x. This has to be assumed,\nthese are the 1, 2 and 3.\nSo, we are going to solve some problems that\nwill demonstrate this momentum thickness,\ndisplacement thickness and energy thickness.\nSo, the question is, find the displacement\nthickness, the momentum thickness and the\nenergy thickness for the velocity distribution\nin the boundary layer which is given by, u\n/ U = y / delta. This is the velocity profile.\nSo, this is one of the most simplest problems\nthat we are going to see in this part. So,\nhow to solve that? What I am going to do is,\nI will go to my usual white screen.\nSo, we will start writing the things that\nare given. So, the things that are given is,\nu / U is equal to y / delta. By definition,\ndisplacement thickness, delta dash is given\nas, 0 to delta 1 minus u / U and into dy.\nSo, using this term here, we can use, we can\nwrite, delta dash again as, integral 0 to\ndelta 1 minus, so, this is bracket, 1 - y\n/ delta dy. Delta dash can \nbe written as, after integration, 0 to delta\n- 1 / delta because this an integration with\nrespect to y, this will become y square / 2\n0 to delta. Draw a line here.\nSo, delta dash is going to be, delta - 1 / delta\ninto delta square / 2 is equal to delta / 2\nand this delta here is boundary layer thickness.\nThis \nis as we told, this is displacement thickness.\nSo, now going to momentum thickness, this\nis very simple. So, we have written displacement\nthickness, in terms of boundary layer thickness.\nSo, what I am going to do here, I will erase\nall ink on this slide.\nMomentum thickness theta, so, theta definition\nis equal to 0 to delta u / U into 1- u / U\ndy and this is going to be 1 to delta. This\nis going to be u / U – u square / U \nsquare into dy and using the velocity profile,\nwe can write, integral 0 to delta u / U is\ngoing to be, y / delta minus y square / delta\nsquare into dy or removing the integration\nsign, 1 / delta would come out and this is\ngoing to be, y square / 2.\nSo, this is y square and the limits is going\nto be 0 to delta minus, this delta square\nis constant it is coming out and this becomes,\ny cube / 3 and the limit is 0 to delta. So,\nmomentum thickness theta, can be written as,\ndelta / 2 - delta / 3 here, is equal to delta\n/ 6, which implies, delta / 6. So, this is\nmomentum thickness.\nNow, the energy thickness, delta double dash,\nthe definition is, integral 0 to delta u / U\ninto 1 - u square / U square into dy \nand this is going to be, 0 to delta u / U\n- u cube / U cube into dy and after substituting\nthe velocity profile, this is going to be,\n0 to delta, the limits, y / delta - y cube\n/ delta cube and all into dy. So, we have\nnot yet integrated it. Now, the next step\nis to integrate and after integrating this,\nwhat we get is, 1 / delta is common, so, it\ncomes, y square / 2, 0 to delta minus, this\ncomes out to be this is constant.\nSo, this comes out and y cube becomes y to\nthe power 4 / 4 and the limit is 0 to delta.\nAnd therefore, the energy thickness here is,\nthis will come out to be, delta / 2 and this\ncomes out to be, delta / 4. So, the energy\nthickness is coming out to be, delta / 4 energy\nthickness and this is boundary layer thickness.\nSo, this is one of the simplest problems in\nthe boundary layer analysis. So, you have\nto attack all the problems like this.\nSo, we proceed to the next problem. So, our\nnext problem is, find the displacement thickness,\nthe momentum thickness and the energy thickness\nfor the velocity distribution in the boundary\nlayer, that is, given by u / U equal to. So,\nwe have another velocity profile, similar\nto problem number 1. So, we will solve this\nproblem, as well. So, for doing that we are\ngoing to have white screen again.\nAnd as always, we start with the thing, that\nis, given. What is given to us? u / U equal\nto 2y / delta - y square / delta square. And\naccording to definition of the displacement\nthickness, that is, delta star, definition\nis 0 to delta 1- u / U into dy. So, it is\nquite simple, we use this velocity profile\nhere, we plug it in, and we first write, integral\n0 to delta is equal to 1 – 2y / delta plus,\nthis minus becomes plus, y square / delta\nsquare into dy. So, now there are 3 terms\nto integrate.\nSo, we are going to do, delta dash is equal\nto this 1 into dy, will be, y 0 to delta - 2\n/ delta y square / 2 0 to delta plus 1 / delta\nsquare is constant. So, this becomes, y cube\n/ 3 0 to delta. So, displacement thickness\nis going to be, delta – delta + delta / 3\nand this gives us delta / 3. So, the displacement\nthickness \nis coming out to be, delta / 3. Now, similarly,\nwe have to find the momentum thickness.\nSo, theta is the momentum thickness. Going\nby the definition, 0 to delta u / U into 1\nminus u / U dy. And we substitute the velocity\nprofile here, so, it will be u / U - u square\n/ U square. So, it will become, 2y / delta\n- y square / delta square - 4y square / delta\nsquare - y to the power 4 divided by delta\nto the power 4 + 4y cube / delta cube the\nwhole dy. And now, we can integrate, this\nwill be, 2 / delta y square / 2 from 0 to\ndelta - 1 / delta square and this y square\nwill turn out to be, y cube / 3 0 to delta\n- 4 / delta square y cube / 3 and this will\nbe, minus 1 to the power 4 delta 4 and this\nwill be come y to the power 5 / 5 from 0 to\ndelta and the last term is going to be, 4\n/ delta cube outside, and y cube becomes y\nto the power 4 / 4 0 to delta.\nAnd this will come out to be, the first term\nis going to be, delta. Second term is going\nto be, minus delta / 3 - 4 delta / 3 - delta\n/ 5 + delta. So, momentum thickness is going\nto be, 2 delta / 15. So, this is the momentum\nthickness. Now, the last part before we conclude\ntodays\nIs the energy thickness, delta double dash.\nSo, delta double dash, first, what we do is,\nwe write the equations, 0 to delta u / U 1\n- u square / U square dy. And after we substitute\nthe velocity profile, what we get? Integral\n0 to delta, 0 to delta, it is going to be,\nso, 2 y / delta - 8y cube / delta cube - 2y\nto the power 5 / delta to the power 5 + 8,\nbear with me, because so many terms, but this\nis the beginning, so I am not skipping anything,\nnot trying to take anything for granted, plus\n4y to the power 4 / delta to the power 4 +\ny to the power 6 / delta to the power 6 - 4y\nto the power 5 / delta to the power 5 dy.\nAnd now on integrating actually, and putting\nin the limits, what you are going to get is,\ndelta - delta / 3 - 2 delta + 12 delta / 5\n– delta + delta / 7. So, the energy thickness\nis going to be 22 delta / 105. This is the\nenergy thickness for this particular problem.\nSo, this problem is also solved.\nSo, now, we will close this lecture and start\nour new lecture, lecture number 3 by solving\nthis problem number 3 and then we proceed\nto the next topic. So, that is enough for\ntoday and I will see you in the next lecture.\nThank you so much.",
    "video_16": "Welcome back to the continuation of the boundary\nlayer analysis lecture.\nSo, we are going to start this lecture by\nsolving yet another problem, where the 2 velocity\nprofiles is given, one for the laminar flow\nhere, and one for the turbulent flow. This\nis for the turbulent flow. So, this is laminar\nand this is turbulent. We are going to the\nratio of the displacement thickness, delta\ndash / ratio of delta for laminar and the\nturbulent cases, for 2 separate cases. So,\nto we will start.\nWe will go to white screen and we will start\ndoing the solution. For lamina boundary layer,\nu / U is given as, 3 / 2 - y / delta - half\ny cube by, so, let me just. Yeah, so, there\nis some mistake in my writing.\nSo, actually the laminar was u / U = 3 / 2\ny / delta - half y cube / delta cube, this\nis laminar velocity profile. And therefore\nthe, by definition, the displacement thickness\nis 0 to delta 1 - u / U dy and we substitute\nthis velocity profile, here, and we are going\nto get, integral of 0 to delta 1 - 3 / 2 y\n/ delta + half y cube / delta cube into dy\nand after integration, which we are going\nto get, y from 0 to delta - 3 / 2 delta and\nthis is going to be, y square / 2 0 to delta\n+ 1 / 2 delta cube y to the power 4 / 4 0\nto delta.\nAnd the displacement thickness is going to\nbe, this first term will be, delta - 3 / 4\ndelta + 1 / 8, this is 8 delta. This will\ngive us, delta dash is equal to 3 / 8 delta\nand this implies that delta dash / delta for\nlaminar case is going to be, very simple.\nThis we have been doing. Anyways. now, we\nwill do for turbulent boundary layer.\nu / U is the velocity profile is y / delta\nto the power 1 / 7. So, the displacement thickness\nby definition is, 0 to delta 1 - u / U dy\nand we plug it in here. And therefore, what\nwe get is, integral 0 to delta 1 - y / delta\nto the power 1 / 7 dy or we get, delta star\nas, after integrating and putting the limit,\n0 to delta - 1 / delta to the power 1 / 7\ninto 7 / 8 into y to the power 8 / 7 divided,\nno, and this also goes from 0 to delta.\nAnd therefore, this comes out to be, after\nlimit delta, second term will be, 7 / 8 into\ndelta or this is going to be, 1 / 8 delta.\nTherefore, displacement thickness and this\nis for turbulent. So, this is what the turbulent\nboundary layer. So, this question is complete.\nAnd now, we can proceed to another topic,\nthat is, von Karman momentum integral equation.\nSo, what we do is, we consider a uniform flow\npast a flat plate of width b. So, the width\nof the plate is B. So, this is the definitions\nare as usual, a uniform velocity U is coming\nand it strikes the leading edge here, and\nthen the boundary layer would start to develop\nand at the end of the boundary layer where\nthe boundary layer the thickness is delta\nx, there will be a shear stress developing\ntau w, as a function of x.\nSo, we have written the, I mean, we have shown\nthe figure again on the right hand side. So,\nwhat is the assumption? The assumption is\nthat the pressure is constant throughout the\nflow field. The flow entering the control\nvolume at section 1, here, this is uniform,\nleading edge of the plate. So, the flow entering\nthe control volume at section 1, section 1\nis the leading edge of the plate is uniform.\nAnd the velocity of the flow at section 2,\nhere, varies from 0 to U, and this happens\nbecause of the boundary layer. So, this is\nthe assumption that we start with.\nSo, the fluid in the immediate vicinity of\nthe plate makes up the lower portion of the\ncontrol volume. So, you see the control surface\nhere. So, we have chosen a control surface\nhere. This control surface, it says, that\nthe fluid in the immediate vicinity. So, this\none you see, the dash, dash line, now, I am\nmarking it red, red, red dots, this is the\nlower portion of the control volume. And the\nupper surface of the control volume coincides\nwith the streamline just outside the edge\nof the boundary layer. So, you see, this is\nthe top most surface of the control volume.\nNow, if you apply the conservation of linear\nmomentum along x direction for steady flow,\nwhat do we get? So, you do you remember this\nequation from somewhere, just a quick thought?\nYes, it is Reynolds transport theorem that\nwe did in week number 2. So, the conservation\nof linear momentum along steady along the\nx direction for the steady flow gives us sigma\nFx is equal to rho integral uV dot ndA + rho\nuV dot ndA, that are the 2 surfaces, at 2\ndifferent surfaces. For steady flow therefore,\nthere is no time variation.\nWe can also write, so, drag sigma Fx is equal\nto - of F drag. So, drag will have happened\nbecause of this shear stress here. And this\nis as I told, is due to taw W.\nNow, this equation number 4, can be written\nas, - F drag. So, I will, so, this is the\nequation, we write, rho U - U into bh + integral\n0 to delta u square bdy. And this gives us\nequation 5. What we did it? We just use substituted\nthe equation 4 and input in the velocities.\nAnd this is section 1, where uniform flow\nwas there and here the boundary layer. And\nnow, you can understand why 2 different forms\nof momentums we have written.\nAnd this is minus U, because the velocity\nvector makes an angle of 180 degree with the\nnormal. So, this was the control surface,\nyou remember, something like this. So, the\nvelocity was in this direction and the normal\nto this surface was here. So, that is why\n180 degrees, or simply, we multiplied - 1\non both side. This becomes F drag is equal\nto rho U square bh - rho integral 0 to delta\nu square bdy. This U is capital, this u is\nsmall.\nFrom the conservation of mass, the flow rate\nthrough section 1, here, must equal the mass\nflow rate through section 2, that is, correct.\nTherefore, we can write, U into h. So, U into\nh is equal to integral u dy. If you assume,\nyou know, thickness element of thickness and\nat distance y, the velocity is u, so, it becomes\nu dy. Very simple.\nSo, if we multiply rho Ub to both side of\nthe equation 6, this is equation 6. So, we\nget, rho U, capital U square, so, we multiply\nthis term, rho U b. So, for the left hand\nside becomes rho U square bh, is equal to\nrho b U u dy and this is integrated to 0 to\ndelta. Now, if we substitute this equation,\nequation 7 into equation number 5. I will\ntake you to equation number 5 again.\nSo, this was equation number 5, with the drag\nforce equation. What we get? F drag is going\nto be, rho b integral. So, the idea was to\nsubstitute the first term in equation number\n5 by this. So, it will be written as, rho\nb integral 0 to delta U u dy and this was\nalready there, in the equation number 5.\nOr simply, if we take some terms outside and\ntake the common, it becomes forced drag, F\ndrag will become rho b integral of 0 delta\nu multiplied by the velocity deficit into\ndy. Simply, in other words, if you take, if\nyou or, I mean, you multiply this side by\nU square and divide this, so, it will not\nmake a difference U then you get, rho b U\nsquare integral of u / U into 1 - u / U dy,\nvery simple.\nSimply, I will write, multiply and divide\nRHS with U square then you can get this. So\nnow, what is this? You remember? This is the\nmomentum thickness, theta. Remember from our\nlast lecture? So, F drag can simply be written\nas, rho b U square theta, where rho is the\ndensity, b is the width of the plate, U is\nthe free stream velocity and theta is the\nmomentum thickness.\nIf we differentiate both sides, with respect\nto x, this equation, equation number 8, if\nwe differentiate, we can get, dF drag / dx\nis equal to, simply, rho b U square, other\nthings are constant become d theta dx and\nwe can write this as equation number 9. Also,\nwe know that, this drag was due to integration\nof shear stress or the entire area, integral\ntau w b dx. We get. if we differentiate this,\nwith respect to x, we get, simply, this integration\nsign will go and it will become dF drag / dx\nis equal to taw w b.\nAnd then, you know, what needs to be done.\nWe are going to substitute, I mean, equate\nequation number 9 and equation number 10 and\nwe get, taw w is equal to rho U square d theta\n/ dx. I will just, I mean, very elementary,\nbut let me show you, rho b U square . So,\nrho b U square d theta dx is equal to tau\nw b. So, b will get cancelled here. So, tau\nw will become rho U square d theta dx.\nSo, this is what it is written here and this\nfamous equation is called von Karman Momentum\nIntegral Equation, a core component of this\nmodule and the hydraulics, in general. And\nthis, the beauty of this equation is, it can\nbe applied to both laminar and turbulent boundary\nlayers. So, this is the general equation,\nbecause we have not at any point in time assumed\nwhether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\nNow, what are the boundary conditions at the\nplate? It is very simple, u, the velocity\nat the plate is going to be 0. The second\ncondition is, d square u / dy square at y\nis equal to 0. This is the second boundary\ncondition. Now, the third boundary condition\nis at the top of the boundary layer. This\nmeans that the velocity at the top of the\nboundary, that is, the free stream velocity\nand this is no slip and the velocity gradient\nat the top of the boundary layer is going\nto be 0. Now, we will use all these boundary\nconditions in our further analysis.\nWith this, we are going to start solving one\nproblem. The question says, an approximate\nexpression for the velocity profile in a steady\n2-D incompressible boundary layer is given\nby the following function. Now, we have to\nshow that the profile satisfy u at, I mean,\nwe have to see that the boundary conditions\nare actually satisfied or not. These are the\nvelocity profile. And here, eta is y / delta.\nSo, to solve the question we are going to\ngo to the white screen.\nSo, we have been given, u / U is equal to\n1 - e to the power – eta + K into 1 - e\nto the power -eta - sin pi eta / 6. And this\nis for eta, greater than or equal to 0 or\ngreater than or equal to 3. Also, u / U is\nequal to 1- e to the power - eta - K e to\nthe power - eta and this is for, eta greater\nthan or equal to 3.\nHere, eta is given as, y / delta. So, actually,\nwhen y is equal to 0, implies, eta is equal\nto 0. When y is equal to delta, eta is equal\nto 1, and when y is equal to infinity, implies,\neta is equal to infinity. So, first part where,\nnow, u / U at y is equal to 0, can be written\nas, u / U y is equal to 0 is equal to u / U.\nSimply, y is equal to 0, means, eta is equal\nto 0.\nTherefore, u / U at eta is equal to 0, can\nbe written as, 1 – 1 + K into 1 - 1 - 0.\nSo u / v is equal to 0, implies, sorry, not\nv, u / U, implies, u at y is, I will go to\nthe white screen again.\nSimply, u at y is equal to 0 is 0, thus proved.\nFor y is equal to infinity, eta is equal to\ninfinity. Therefore, u / U is equal to 1 - e\nto the power - K eta to the power. Therefore,\nu is equal to U - U K e to the power 1 - eta.\nNow, u at y is equal to infinity is equal\nto u at eta is equal to infinity is equal\nto U - U into 0 - U into K into 0. So, therefore,\nu at y is equal to infinity is equal to U\nand thus second part is also proved.\nSo, now, del u / del y is equal to del u / del\neta into del eta / del y, implies, del u / del\ny is equal to del del y of y / delta into\ndel u / del eta is equal to 1 / delta into\ndel u / del eta. This is another equation.\nAnd we have seen the equation number 1 before,\nthat U was, which we just wrote it, U is equal\nto U – K e to the power - eta - e to the\npower – eta, this was 1 actually. So, differentiating\nboth sides of equation 1,with respect to eta,\nwe get, del u / del eta is equal to, this\nis equation 1, equal to U e to the power - eta\n+ U K e to the power - eta, that is, equation\nnumber 3. Now, del u / del y at y is equal\nto infinity is equal to del u / del y at eta\nis equal to, n is equal to infinity using\nboth and this comes out to be, 1 / delta u\ne to the, capital U e to the power – infinity\n+ U K to the power - infinity and this comes\nout to be, 1 / delta 0 + 0. Thus, del u / del\ny at y is equal to infinity is 0.\nSo, there is one more part left. For del square\n/ del square u / del square, del square u\n/ del y square. But I will leave it up to\nyou to prove it. Try yourself at home using\nthis maths that we have seen. So, this concludes\nthe problem for today. And we will start with\nanother problem, problem number 5 when we\nresume next. Thank you so much.",
    "video_17": "Welcome back. Last class we started solving\nproblem 7 and finished it where we determine\nthe shear stress and the drag force by the\ntechnique that was taught in the lecture itself.\nNow, we are going to proceed to apply, the\nvon Karman momentum integral method for turbulent\nboundary layer over a flat plate because that\nparticular equation was valid both for laminar\nand turbulent fluid flow. Actually, Prandtl\nassumed one-seventh power law velocity distribution\nfor turbulent boundary layer. That was his\nassumption and he said, for turbulent boundary\nlayer u / U is a function of eta, and eta\nis 1 to the power 1 / 7, where eta, the usual\nmeaning is, eta = y / delta. y is the distance\nabove the plate and delta is the boundary\nlayer thickness. And since that von Karman\nmomentum integral equation is applicable here\ntoo.\nIt yields, tau w = 7 / 72 rho U square d delta\n/ dx, if you follow the same procedure, this\nequation is more important. Now, Blasius gave\nthe following expression for wall shear for\na hydro dynamically smooth surface. He said\nthat, tau w = 2.28 into 10 to the power - 2\nrho U square into nu / delta u raised to the\npower 0.25. This is another equation. Now,\nif equate both.\nThis is the equation that we get, delta as\na function of delta and x. And if we integrate\nthe above equation, we are going to get, lambda\nto the power 0.5 delta, sorry, delta to the\npower 0.25 d delta = integration from 0 to\nx 0.235 nu / U raised to the power 0.25 dx\nand then we can obtain expression like this\nor if we multiply x here, and x here, as well\nand take it out here, we can actually write,\nthis x becomes x to the power 1.25. And this\nis Reynolds number, a similar expression.\nSo, simply what we have done is, so, this\nwas delta to the power 1.25. So, this will\nbecome 0.25 divided by 1.25.\nWhen in writing in terms 0.294 will become\n0. 376 x into the Reynolds number to the power\n– 0.2 and this is valid for Reynolds number\n5 into 10 to the power 5 between 10 to the\npower 7. This is the boundary layer value\nfor a turbulent flow. Now, some observations,\nif you see, remember, the laminar boundary\nlayer was delta x was a function of x to the\npower 1 / 2. For a turbulent boundary layer\nis a function of x to the power 0.8.\nSo, this means that the turbulent boundary\nlayer grows faster, you see, as it grows as\nx to the power 0.8, and this grows at x to\nthe power 0.5.\nThere is some, a term called local coefficient\nof drag C D star. So, C D star is given by,\nnothing, it is the ratio of tau w, the shear\nstress near the wall divided by 1 / 2 rho\nU square. Average coefficient of drag C D\nis C D is given by force drag divided by half\nrho A U square. So, this is the ratio of the\nshear stresses sort of and this is the ratio\nof forces.\nSo, now the analysis gives us, that for Reynolds\nnumber between 5 into 10 to the power 5 and\n10 to the power 7, this is what we got, boundary\nlayer thickness was 0. 376 multiplied by x\ninto multiplied by Reynolds number to the\npower - 0.2 and C D gave us 0.072 into R e\nat L to the power 1 / 5. As if you put in\nthose values we can get, C D as follows. Where,\nR e at length L, is U L / nu where L is the\nlength of the plate.\nAnd for increasing, so, if your Reynolds number\nis more than 10 to the power 7 Schlichting\ngave an empirical equation, that gave, C D\nas 0.455 divided by log 10 to a Reynolds number\nto the power 2.58. But you do not need to\nmemorize this equation. So, now using this\nanalysis of turbulent boundary layer over\na flat plate, what we are going to do is,\nwe are going to solve some problem.\nThis actually is always a good method for\nunderstanding the complex problems of the\nboundary layer analysis in turbulent boundary\nlayer.\nSo, we start with the problem that says that\nthe water flows over a flat plate at a free\nstream velocity of U 0.15 meters per second,\nthat is, U. There is no pressure gradient\nand the laminar boundary layer is 6 millimeters\nthick. Assume sinusoidal velocity profile,\nlike this. Calculate the wall shear stress\nand the local coefficient of drag. So, we\nhave to calculate the wall shear stress and\nlocal coefficient of drag. So, how do we attack\nthis problem?\nSo, as always we are going to have the things\nthat are given. So, given, U is 0.15 meters\nper second, delta is 6 millimeters or delta\nis 6 into 10 to the power - 3 meters, for\nexample, and u / U is sin of pi / 2 into y\n/ delta and mu here is given as 1.02 into\n10 to the power - 3 Newton second per meter\nsquare. So, now, we do, du / dy, for example,\nthat gives us d dy of u, u comes this side\nsin pi / 2 y / delta. So this gives us, U\nwill come out cos pi / 2 y / delta into pi\n/ 2 delta.\nSo, now, du / dy at y = 0 will be, we substitute\ny = 0 here. So, this becomes pi U / 2 delta.\nIf we put y = 0 this cos term is going to\nbe 1. And we know that tau 0 = mu du / dy\nat y = 0. So, tau 0 is going to be mu du / dy\nat y = 0 again. So, what we write is, mu is\n1.02 into 10 to the power - 3 into, I will\nwrite it on the next line, so, tau 0 is going\nto be 1.02 into 10 to the power - 3 into pi\n/ 2 into U / delta.\nAnd after substituting in the value, 1.02\ninto 10 to the power - 3 into pi / 2 into\nU is 0.15 and delta is 6 into 10 to the power\n– 3, tau 0 comes to be 0.04 Newton per meter\nsquare, very simple to solve. So, local coefficient\nof drag C D star is given as, tau 0 / half\nrho U square and simply putting in the value\n0.04 divided by half into 1000 and U is 0.15\nwhole square and this comes out to be 3.55\ninto 10 to the power - 3 or C D star finally\nis 3.55 into 10 to the power – 3.\nSo, one very simple question, how to be, I\nmean, just by using the definitions of C D\nand the shear stress near the wall, we have\nfound out this.\nSo, this was one problem. We will see another\nproblem, which says that air at standard conditions\nflows over a flat plate. The free stream velocity\nis 3 meters per second. Find delta and tau\nw at x = 1 meter from the leading edge. Assume\na cubic velocity profile. For air, nu = 1.5\ninto 10 to the power -5 meter square per second\nand rho = 1.23 kilogram per meter cube.\nSo, what we are going to do? We are going\nto given, U = 3 meters per second, nu = 1.5\ninto 10 to the power - 5 meters square per\nsecond and rho is given as 1.23 kilogram per\nmeter cube. So, we have seen that cubic boundary\nlayer profile is u / U = 3 / 2, from our laminar\nanalysis, - half y / delta cube. For which\nboundary layer thickness is 4.64 x under root\nR e of x and tau w is 3 / 2 mu U / delta.\nSo, at x = 1 meter, Reynolds number at x is\ngoing to be U x / nu, so, 3 into 1 divided\nby 1.5 into 10 to the power - 5 and this is\ngoing to be 2 into 10 to the power, so, basically\nlaminar.\nNow, delta is going to be 4.64 into 1 divided\nby under root 2 into 10 to the power 5 and\nthis gives us 0.0104 meter. This is the delta.\nAnd tau w will give us 3 / 2 nu into rho into\nU / delta. So, this is going to be 3 / 2 into\n1.5 into 10 to the power - 5 into 1000, nu\nis directly given, into 1.23 into 3 divided\nby 0.0104. So, this is the way tau w can be\nfound out, just do some multiplication. I\nwill write it again, 3 / 2 into 1.5 into 10\nto the power - 5 into 1000 into 1.23 into\n3 divided by 0.0104. So this is some small\nproblems. That we are doing using the.\nSo, now, this gives us another, we will solve\nanother problem. If we consider a laminar\nboundary layer on a flat plate with a velocity\nprofile given by the cubic velocity profile,\nthat is, what we have seen for this profile,\nwe already know. Determine the expression\nfor local coefficient of drag. So, how to\ndo that?\nSo, we know everything here before So, we\nwill get directly to the point here. For given\nprofile we have already derived that tau 0\nis 3 / 2 times mu times U, sorry. Sorry, I\nwill write it again. We have seen that tau\n0 = 3 / 2 mu U / delta implies tau 0 = 3 / 2\nmu will remain mu, U will remain U but delta\nis the equation we had derived 4.64 x under\nroot R e of x. So, this is our tau 0, or if\nwe just simplify it more, this 3 / 2 and 4.64,\nit will become 0.323 into mu U / x under root\nR e x.\nNow, what is the local coefficient of drag?\nTau 0 / half rho U square. So, C D star tau\n0 is 0.323. So, basically this is a sort of\na derivation of steps which some results which\nI showed you directly. So, now this is the\nderivation in terms of a question. And I basically\nskipped it so that they could solve it as\na question. So, mu U / x under root R e x\ndivided / 0.5 rho U square or C D star = 0.323\nU / x under root R e x into 0.5 rho U square.\nSo, you can actually cut this U and U here\none so C D star can be written as 0.323 divided\nby 0.5 mu / rho U x under root R e x. So,\nC D star is equal to, this will be 0.646 and\nnow, this mu / rho is nu and this is U under\nroot R e x or 0.646 and this is Reynolds number.\nSo, C D star finally can be written as 0.646.\nI will take the eraser write it properly 0.646\ndivided by under root, so, this is the drag\ncoefficient 0.646. So, this is the solution\nto one of the other questions.\nOne more problem. So, the velocity profile\nfor a laminar boundary layer is given by,\nso it is not a cubic but it is a one more\nterm. Obtains an expression for the boundary\nlayer thickness, shear stress on the plate,\ndrag force on the plate and the average drag\ncoefficient? So, this is a question where\nyou have to find almost everything. So, you\nhave to closely follow the procedure here.\nI will try to lay down the procedure and write\nthe results, but you are expected to solve\nthis problem at your own, at your home.\nSo, we have been given. So, problem number\n11 is, we have been given, u / U is 2 y / delta\n- 2 y / delta whole cube + y / delta to the\npower 4. So, first thing that we calculate\nthe momentum thickness because that is required\nin von Karman momentum integral equation.\nSo, it is 0 to delta u / U into 1 - u square\n/ U square dy. So, this profile you substitute\nin this equation.\nAnd after substituting you integrate in with\nrespect to y, y vary from 0 to delta and what\nyou are going to obtain, I will just write\ndown. There are many terms so one of the term,\nfirst term will be delta - 4 delta / 3 - delta\n/ 2 + 9 / 5 delta - 2 delta / 3 - 4 delta\n/ 3 + delta / 2 - delta / 9. So, the momentum\nthickness that you are going to get is 37\ndelta / 315. Now, this is the first. Second,\nyou have to use momentum integral equation.\nThis is the first step.\nSecondly, what you do is, in any type of such\ntype of equation? Use momentum integral equation.\nAnd what do you do? Tau 0 is rho u square\nd theta dx and we substitute theta here from\nthis one and what you do is, so tau 0 can\nbe written as rho U square into 37 / 315 d\ndelta / dx. So, this is tau 0. This is equation\nnumber 1. Second, is you use Newton's law\nof viscosity.\nUse Newton's law of, this is the standard\nway to solve all the sum, if you follow this\neverything is easy, is equal to mu du / dy\nat y = 0. So, u velocity profile we already\nknow from here. So, this point and we do this\ntau 0 will be, so, after differentiating what\nwe get is 2 U / delta - 2 U / delta cube into\n3 y square + U / delta to the power 4 into\n4 y cube and you substitute y = 0. Therefore,\nyou get tau 0 = 2 mu U / delta.\nThis is number 2. So, this is 1 and this is\n2. And what is the best way? You equate equation\nnumber 1 and equation number 2. So, we will\ngo to another page.\nSo, after equating, you get, 2 mu U / delta\n= rho U square into 37 divided / 315 d delta\n/ dx and if you integrate it, so it will become\nsomething like delta d delta will, before\nintegration 630 / 37 into mu dx / rho into\nU, or delta square / 2 = 630 / 37 U x / rho\nu + C. The boundary condition here is, that\nthe boundary condition at the leading edge\nis going to be the boundary layer is going\nto be 0, which gives C = 0.\nSo, this is leading edge. This is the boundary\ncondition. So, implies if you put here in\nterms of, because this is going to be Reynolds\nnumber, 1 / Reynolds number. So, this is going\nto give you delta = 5.84 x / under root R\ne x. So, this is how you get delta. Now, you\ncan get, obtain, 2 mu U / delta. So, delta\nis known from here and everything else is\nknown. So, you can obtain tau 0 as 0.34 mu\nU / x under root R e x. Now, the drag force\nis simply nothing but 0 to L tau 0 b dx.\nAnd if you substitute in terms of x, you are\ngoing to find out, I think you do this at\nhome, you substitute all these values tau\n0 in terms of x, also use Reynolds number\nyou put at U and x and everything and then\nyou can get 0.68 b mu U under root rho U L\n/ mu. This actually is Reynolds number at\nL. But anyways, this is the thing. And lastly,\nis the remaining is the drag coefficient,\nyou know.\nC D is given by F D divided by half rho A\nU square. So, F D you know, everything is\nknown. So, I will just show in a little more\ndetail, it is 0.68 b mu U under root rho U\nL / mu divided by half rho b is, the area\nis b into length into U square and this will\ngive us 1.36 into 1 / rho U L / nu. Or finally,\nC D is 1.36 / under root R e into L. Where,\nR e Reynolds number at length L is rho U L\n/ mu.\nSo, this is how you have seen for any velocity\nprofile, we are able to find out almost all\nthe parameters that we know. So, what we do\nis we will stop this lecture here and resume\nwith a problem, and then in the next class.\nAnd then we will go to the final chapter of\nthe boundary layer analysis. It might require\n1 or 2 more lectures. Thank you so much.",
    "video_18": "Welcome back. So, till now we have seen many\nproblems on the laminar and turbulent boundary\nlayer. This is a similar type of question\nthat we did last time but instead this has\nsome values in it. So, we have been given\nthe thickness of the boundary layer, we have\nbeen given the length of the plate, we have\nbeen given how much wide is it and what is\nthe U it is given, the viscosity is given.\nSo what I am going to do is, we are going\nto solve this particular problem.\nI mean, not in the entire detail but I will\noutline the procedure. So, velocity profile\nis given. So, I will definitely write what\nis given. So, u / U is given 3 / 2, so, this\nis the, sorry, 1 / 2, and we also have been\ngiven that the length of the plate is 2 meter,\nb is 1.4 meter and the U is also given as\n200 into 10 to the power minus 3 meters per\nsecond and mu is also given as 0.001 Newton\nmeter per second squared.\nSo, what do we do? When x is equal to 1.5\nmeter, Reynolds number at x is going to be\nrho Ux / mu. So, after you substitute all\nthese value, it will come 3 into 10 to the\npower 5. So, basically, it is laminar. And\nfor laminar boundary layer delta, we know,\n4.64 x under root Re at x and after substituting\nthis x and Re what we get is 0.013 meter.\nSo, this is the boundary layer thickness.\nSo, boundary layer thickness and for that\nwe have already have derived 3 / 2 mu U / Delta\nand after substituting in the values, you\nwill get 0.0231 Newton per meter square. This\nis simply substituting in the values.\nAnd similar, if we put in F D, the drag force\nthat we have derived in the last thing, so\nit will come out to be 0.114 Newton. You should\nverify it actually. Just substitute in the\nvalues, because this was on one side. So,\ntotal is going to be, total force is 2 sides,\n2F D, so, it is going to be 0.229 Newton.\nSo, this is the same question but with numerical\nvalues\nSo, now we solve this question. This is typically\nan interesting one, a sort of a derivation\nof the, I mean, of the turbulent boundary\nlayer von Karman analysis. So, this one I\nwill go, that you are able to follow. So,\nlet me first go and tell you what the question\nis, it says, that the velocity profile for\nturbulent boundary layer, so, the velocity\nprofile for turbulent boundary layer is given\nby one by seventh power law. Obtain an expression\nfor the drag force and the average coefficient\nof drag, in terms of Reynolds number.\nActually we have already seen those equations\nwithout going into too much detail, but here\nwe can derive it. The wall shear stress for\nturbulent shear boundary layer is given as,\ntau 0 is given. So, how to attack this problem?\nWe simply go white screen.\nSo, we write the things that are given. So,\nu / U is given as y / delta to the power 1\n/ 7, where tau 0 is 0.0225 rho U square into\nmu / rho U Delta to the power 1 / 4. So, we\nhave seen, for turbulent boundary layer, delta\nis given as 0.376 x into Re at x to the power\nminus 0.2, or delta is given as 0 0.376x divided\nby Re x to the power 0.2. So, substituting\nthis delta into the shear stress, if you substitute\nthis, so, tau 0 will \nbe 0.0225 rho U square into mu / rho U and\nin place of delta, we put this, so, delta\nwill be 0.376x into Re x to the power 1 / 5\nand to the power 1 / 4.\nOn rearranging, we can get, tau is equal to,\nso, there are some step,s which you will have\nto do, 0.0287. I will not miss those steps\nbecause that might be more. So, this will\nbecome 0.0225 divided by, this will come out,\n0.376 to the power 1 / 4 rho U square u / rho\nU to the power 1 / 4 rho U x / mu to the power\n1 / 5 to the power 1 / 4 into 1 to the power\nx to the power 1 / 4.\nSo, if you multiply x here and x here and\non rearrangement this expression actually\ncan give you, tau 0 is equal to 0.0287 rho\nU square into 1 / Re to the power x 4 / 5\nto the power 1 / 5, or tau 0 = 0.0287 rho\nU square divided by Re to the power x into\n1 / 5.\nSo, now, F D is equal to integral 0 to L tau\n0 b dx. If you substitute this and integrate\nit, we are going to get, we already have this\ntau 0, in terms of Reynolds number to the\npower 1 / 5, so, I will just to be, you know,\nto make it complete, 0 to L tau 0, can be\nwritten as, 0.0287 rho U square divided by\nRe x to the power 1 / 5 b dx. Now, Re should\nbe written, in terms of Ux, I mean, the usual\nnumbers and FD on simplification, will come\nout to be 0.036 into rho U square b L divided\nby Re L to the power 1 / 5.\nAnd C D in the end, will be F D divided by\nhalf rho AU square, F D will be this thing,\nA is going to be b into L, for example. Therefore,\nC D is going to be 0.072 divided by Re to\nthe power L to the power 1 / 5. Same way of\nsolution, so, no difference. So, if you get\na velocity profile you can proceed it in a\nsimilar way, given that for a turbulent flow\nthe shear stress profile is given.\nSo, now, we have to study about something\ncalled the boundary layer separation. What\nis boundary layer separation? So, we have\nseen, the mechanism of the formation of the\nboundary layer, as such. So, along the length\nof the solid body, the thickness of the boundary\nlayer increases, that we have already seen.\nAnd the fluid layer next to the solid surface\nhas to do work against the surface friction,\nthat is true.\nAnd this work is done at the expense of the\nkinetic energy. The loss of the kinetic energy\nis recovered from the immediate fluid layer\nin contact; through the momentum exchange.\nHence, the velocity of the layer goes on decreasing.\nSo, along the length of the body, a certain\nstage may come when the kinetic energy is\nno longer sufficient to overcome the frictional\nresistance. I mean, the kinetic energy transport\nfrom the upper layer to the below layer, for\nexample, is no longer sufficient to overcome\nthe frictional resistance. In that case, the\nboundary layer will be separated from the\nsurface and this is called the boundary layer\nseparation.\nThe point on the body at which the boundary\nlayer is on the verge of separation is called\nthe point of separation. The flow reversal\ncan occur at the downstream point of the separation.\nSo, this is the, this is what this phenomena\nis, I mean, this is what exactly this phenomena.\nNow, we are going to see what the effect of\npressure gradient boundary layer separation\nis. So, what is a favorable pressure gradient?\nThat the pressure dP dx is less than 0. So,\npressure at one point, if it is higher than\nthe second point, then the flow will occur.\nSo, that is the favorable pressure gradient.\nIn this case, the flow is accelerated by the\npressure forces. Hence, the boundary layer\nthickness keeps thin and hugs closely to the\nwall in the favorable pressure gradient.\nHowever, in adverse pressure gradient, where,\ndP dx is greater than 0, the outer flow is\ndeaccelerated by the pressure forces, because\nthe pressure forces will act in the opposite\ndirection because of the adverse pressure\ngradient. In that case, the boundary layer\nis usually thicker and does not remain very\nclose to the wall.\nTherefore, the boundary layer separate from\nthe wall which progresses into the main flow\nand this is the, so, this is the flow reversal,\nyou know. You see, this is the point of separation.\nSo, comparison of boundary layer profile shape\nas a function of pressure gradient dP dx is\nminus U du dx. a is a favorable case, you\nsee, b is 0, this one, c is mild adverse because\nthis is a pressure gradient, a different pressure\ngradient, you see, d is critical and the fourth\nis large adverse, you see, the pressure gradient\ndP dx.\nSo, the separation is determined from this,\nwhere the separation point is going to be\nis determined from the condition du / dy at\ny is equal to 0 is equal to 0. So, for a given\nvelocity profile, if du / dy at y is equal\nto 0 is less than 0, this means, that the\nflow has already separated. And if it is equal\nto 0, it is in the verge of separation.\nAnd if it is greater than 0, this means, it\nwill not separate; the flow is attached with\nthe surface. Because du / dy at y is equal\nto 0, the shear stress, that is the main thing.\nYou know, if it is less than 0, that means,\nflow has already separated because.\nSo, now, we are going to solve 2 problems\nrelated to that. One is, for the given velocity\nprofiles, determine whether the boundary layer\nhas separated or on the verge of separation.\nSo, these are the 3 velocity profiles. Very\nsimple, in this velocity profile, we need\nto calculate, du / dy at y is equal to 0.\nSimply, if it is negative it has separated\nif it is not then, now if it is 0, then it\nis on the verge of separation.\nSo, we are going to have this white screen.\nSo, let us say, for part one actually, u / U\nis equal to 2 into y / delta - y / delta whole\nsquare. So, let us do, du / dy, so, this is\ngoing to be, 2U / delta - 2y U / delta square\nand du / dy at y is equal to 0, will give\nus, 2U / delta, which is greater than 0, that\nmeans, flow is attached.\nThe second velocity profile, where u was,\nu / U is - 2 y / delta + half y / delta whole\ncube. Here, du / dy is going to be, minus\n2U / delta + 3U y square / 2 delta cube at\ny is equal to 0 du / dy is going to be, minus\n2U / delta, which is less than 0, that means,\nseparation has occurred. In the third problem,\nwhen you do, third problem has u / U as 3\n/ 2 y / delta whole square + 1 / 2 y / delta\nwhole cube. So, this du / dy is going to be,\n3U y / delta square + 3U y square / 2 delta\ncube. So, that means, at y is equal to 0 du\n/ dy at y is equal to 0 is 0. So, this is\nequal to 0, means, on verge of separation.\nSo, now, one more problem. So, the velocity\ndistribution in the laminar boundary layer\nis of the form u / U is equal to F of ETA\n+ lambda G of ETA, where F of ETA is 3 / 2\nETA - ETA cube / 2, and G of ETA is ETA / 4\n- ETA square / 2 + ETA cube / 4 and ETA is\ny / delta. Find the value of lambda, when\nthe flow is on the verge of separation. So,\nthis is an interesting problem.\nSo, what is given to us, u / U is equal to\nF of ETA + lambda G of ETA, where F ETA and\nG ETA is given. So, from the profile, u can\nbe written as, U F of ETA + U lambda G of\nETA. This is equation number one. So, du / dy\ncan be written as, du / d ETA into d ETA / dy,\nor du / d ETA, can be written as d / d. So,\nd ETA / dy can be actually, this can be written\nas d / dy of y / lambda into du / d ETA, this\nis here, or du / dy can be simply written\nas 1 / lambda into du / d ETA.\nThis is without utilizing that and this is\nequation number 2. If we differentiate this\none, with respect to ETA, what we get is,\ndu / d ETA is equal to Ud d ETA of F of ETA\n+ lambda Ud d ETA of G of ETA. And this will\non putting the values, this will give us,\ndu / d ETA is equal to, so, U 3 / 2 - 3 ETA\nsquare / 2 3 ETA square.\nSo, I will just write down again. This du\n/ d ETA, finally comes out to be, U 3 / 2\n- 3 ETA square / 2 + lambda U into 1 / 4 - ETA\n+ 3 ETA square / 4 and this equation we call\nequation number 3. Substitute 3 in 2, and\nthen we get, du / dy is equal to U / lambda\n3 / 2 - 3 ETA square / 2 + lambda U / Delta\ninto 1 / 4 - ETA + 3. So, when the flow is\non verge of separation, this means, du / dy\nis equal to at y is equal to 0 is 0.\nSo, what we do? We put it equal to 0 and what\nwe obtain is, u / Delta into 3 / 2 + lambda\nU by, there are some other steps, which I\nthink you must do it, 0, or U / Delta you\ntake common. This will give us, 3 / 2 + lambda\n/ 4 is equal to 0, which implies, lambda is\nequal to minus 6. So, for lambda is equal\nto minus 6, the flow is on the verge of separation\nand this is the answer to this question.\nSo, now, the control of boundary layer separation,\nwe are proceeding towards the end. So, how\nthis boundary layer separation can be controlled?\nSo, boundary layer separation is associated\nwith continuous loss of energy. So, that means,\neddy formation is there in the reverse flow\nregion. Hence, separation of boundary is undesirable\nand therefore it needs to be stopped. And\nsome methods for preventing the separation\nof boundary layer include:\nThese are only some. So, if you provide a\nstreamlined profile to the body or we can\nsupply additional energy from a blower, suction\nof the slow moving fluid by a suction slot\nand rotating the boundary in the direction\nof the flow are these some of the measures\nusing which the boundary layer separation\ncan be stopped. So, these are the references,\nas usual for the actually entire hydraulic\nengineering course. And this also concludes\nour topic on boundary layer analysis. Thank\nyou so much. I will see you in the next lecture.\nBye.",
    "video_19": "Welcome back. So, beginning this lecture,\nwe are going to see this problem of pipe flow\nand this is the exact same point where we\nstopped our last lecture.\nSo, there are several steps, I have mentioned\nthis to you before that if you follow these\nsteps carefully, you will be able to tackle\nall the problems that are related to dimensional\nanalysis. So, the step 1 is, you have to list\nall the variables that are involved in the\nproblem. In our case, we know that listing\nthe variables was, one is pressure per unit\nlength, something that needs to be find out.\nThen there is a diameter D, there is the density\nrho, then there is viscosity mu and the velocity\nV. So, first step we have done. We have listed\nall the variables that are involved in the\nproblem.\nSecond step is, we have to express each of\nthese variables in terms of basic dimensions,\nvery simple to do. So, we have to write down\nthe dimensions of all these 5 variables. So,\nvelocity is LT- 1 here, mu is FL - 2T, so,\ndelta pl is FL – 3. These dimensions, if\nyou recall, we had written some slides ago\nwhen we were trying to explain it through\nexperimental procedure and the D is L. Whatever\nremaining it is rho, it is FL – 4 T square.\nSo, this is step 2.\nAfter that, we have to determine the unique\nnumber of pi term. So, what we have seen?\nThe unique number of pi terms. How? So, going\nto tell you now, first I will tell you and\nthen do all the. So, first we have to know\nwhat is k, k is total number of variables.\nSo, in our case, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or we can\ncount here, as well, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, k\nwas 5. And what our minimum numbers of reference\ndimensions that are there? So, that you can\nsee by looking at the dimensions of this variable.\nSo, we have length L also is there, T is also\nthere, F is there. Is there any other term?\nEvery all this 5 of these terms has basic\ndimensions length T and F, F, L, T. So, that\nmeans, suppose if there was no F in any of\nthe 5 variables, then reference dimensions\ncould have been 2. Here, L is also there,\nT is also their, F is also there, so, r will\nbe 3. So, number of Pi terms is going to be\nk – r, according to the Buckingham Pi theorem.\nSo, 2 Pi terms, this is just to explain you\n.\nSo, step 3 says, determine the required number\nof pi terms. So, in our, in this particular\ncase, the basic dimensions are F, L, T. So,\nthat means basic dimensions are 3 total, same\nthing what I have written before. Then the\nnumber of Pi terms are the number of variables,\n5 minus the number of basic dimensions, 3.\nSo, there should be 2 Pi terms for this case.\nWe have already written it and seen it. So,\n3 steps we have done. First step was, determining\nthe, writing the all the variables, second\nwriting their dimensions and third number\ndetermining the number of Pi terms. This forms\nvery crucial first 3steps.\nNow, step 4, we have to select a number of\nrepeating variables, where the number required\nis equal to the number of reference dimension.\nSo, repeating variables will be equal to the\nnumber of reference dimension. In this case,\nwe have how many references dimension? 3.\nSo, number of repeating variables that will\nbe there in all the dimensionless Pi terms\nwill be 3, I mean, repeating variables. So,\n3 repeating variables and this will depend\nupon, 3 repeating variables for this case,\nnot always, for this case of pipe flow.\nAnd why? Because the repeating variable should\nbe equal to the number of reference dimensions,\nin our case it is 3. So, we choose 3 independent\nvariables as repeating variables, so, this\nis also important. So, those 3 repeating variables\nshould be independent, one should not, one\ncannot be obtained from the other. There can\nbe more than one set of repeating variables.\nSo, one set of repeating variables must be\n3 independent variables. So, you cannot have\nboth, for example, mu and nu as repeating\nvariable, for example, or gamma and rho. You\nshould try to avoid this type of repeating\nvalue variables, try to avoid.\nNow, in our this pipe flow case, we have chosen\nrepeating variables as, we had 5 variables,\ndelta pl, we had mu, we have diameter, we\nhave velocity and we have rho. So, this 3\nwe have chosen as repeating variables. We\nnote that these 3 variables by themselves\nare dimensionally independent. So, this is\nan important criteria. Which, I mean, what\ndoes this dimensionally independent means?\nYou are not able to form a dimensionless group\nwith them alone.\nSo, you cannot, no way if you choose D, V\nand rho, you will be able to form a dimensionless\ngroup. So, they are dimensionally independent.\nThat is one of the important criterias of\nchoosing a repeating variable.\nSo, now, the step 5. So, step 4 was, we have\nto select the number of repeating variables,\nwe have chosen that. Now, step 5 is, we have\nto form a Pi term. Now, how is that is formed?\nWe have to form a Pi term by multiplying one\nof the non repeating variables by the product\nof the repeating variables each raised to\nan exponent that will make the combination\ndimensionless. So, this means now, for in\nour particular case, where we had 5 variables,\npressure drop per unit length, mu, D, rho\nand V. We chose 3 as repeating variables,\nwhich means we were left with 2.\nSo, first pi turn will be found, will be formed\nby multiplying one of these. So, out of left\ntwo, we will multiply one. So, we will see,\nwhich we, so, we have D,V and rho. So, we\nhave delta pl left. So, this is the first\nPi term, Pi 1 is going to be, multiplying\none of the non repeating, so I am multiplying\ndelta pl multiplied by product of the repeating\nvariables. So, D to the power a, V to the\npower b and rho to the power c, something\nlike that.\nI mean, we will see exactly how I have done\nin this slide, but yeah. So, but the main\nmessage is, multiplying one of the repeating\nvariables, one of the non repeating variables.\nSo, which is this pressure drop per unit length\nby product of repeating variables and each\nraise to power of an exponent, a, b, c, which\nare still unknown. So, this is how we are\nforming one pi term. Similarly, we can form\nthe second pi term, as well. So, out of the\nin this case, we multiplied only one, for\nthe second Pi term you can multiply the other\nleft one.\nSo, as I did, so, Pi 1 is going to be, delta\npl D to the power a V to the power b rho to\nthe power c. Now, this product should be dimensionless,\nthat is the purpose. So, this should be dimensionless.\nSo, we need to solve for these exponent values.\nHow? So, simply, what we have done here, so,\nwe have written the dimensions of pressure\nper unit length, because we wrote the dimensions\nof each of these, you know, variables, D to\nthe power a, that means, L to the power a.\nV is LT – 1., so, V to the power b and rho\nis FL - 4T square and this to the power c\nshould be having no dimensions.\nSo, no dimension means, F to the power 0,\nL to the power 0, T to the power 0. Normally,\nhow would you solve that? You will collect\nthe powers of F and equate it to 0, you will\ncollect the powers of L and equate it to 0\nand you will collect the powers of T and equate\nit to 0, we will see.\nSo, step 5 still continuing because we are\nforming the, so, you see, I will just take.\nSo, F appears here, so, F to the power 1 and\nF to the power c. So, this will be, there\nis only 2 Fs, so it will become 1 + C is equal\nto 0. For L, it is going to be minus 3 + a\n+ b – 4c is equal to 0. And similarly, for\nT, minus b + 2c is equal to 0. But we have\nwritten it here, in a much, so, see, 1 + c\n= 0, this will give C as, minus 1. So, b is\nequal to 2c, this implies, b is equal to minus\n2 and if we know c and b we can get a here.\nSo, solving these things, we get, a is equal\nto 1, b is equal to minus 2, c is equal to\n1, as we have already found out here. So,\nthis will give us, so, if we put back a, b\nand c in that dimensionless group pi one will\nbecome delta pl into D divided by rho V Square\n. So, now so, first dimensionless we have\nfound out. So, now there is only mu that is\nremaining, that is, non repeating variable.\nSo, in similar way we can form another group.\nSo, we form another group, where we have,\nmu D to the power a V to the power b rho to\nthe power c. One important thing to note that,\nthis a and this a are not equal. So, actually\nwe can write, a star, b star or c star, so\nthat, you do not get confused. But we have\nto solve in a similar way, this a b c will\nbe different from what we have obtained for\nPi 1. Do not simply substitute a b c that\nis obtained from the first dimensionless group.\nIt is a new a b c, small a, small b, small\nc, very important to know.\nSo, we follow the procedure again. So, this\nwas mu, L to the power a V to the power b\nrho to the power c is equal to F0 L0 T0, F\nto the power 0 L to the power 0 and T to the\npower 0. So, if you solve this, we are going\nto get, a is equal to minus 1, b is equal\nto minus 1, c is equal to minus 1. So, 3 equations\nyou can obtain. So, if you see, so it will\nbe same, 1 + c is equal to 0. So, F is from\nhere, and F is here. So if you start collecting\nb, so it will b, 1 – b, 1 – b +2c is equal\nto 0, see, we have already obtained. So, 1-\n2b - 2 is equal to 0. So, if you take 2b,\n1 - 2 is - 1, and this is what we get\nAnd similarly, for b, so - 2 + a + b – 4c\nis equal to 0 and this is going to give us,\na also as, minus 1. But anyways, I will rub\nthis and you can see if we solve this equation,\nwe are going to get a is equal to – 1, b\nis equal to -1 and c is equal to – 1. And\nour new dimensionless group is, mu / DV rho.\nAnd is this term look, does this term look\nsimilar to you? One by Reynolds number. We\nwill come to that.\nNow, the step 6 of a general procedure is,\nwe have to repeat this step 5, if there are\nmore number of repeating variables that are\nleft. So, we have to repeat step 5 for each\nof the remaining repeating variables. There\nwill be cases where you will not get only\n2 dimensionless group, but let us say, 3,\n4, 5 depends how many. In another way, we\ncould also have chosen DV and mu, as another\nrepeating group.\nI mean, it is not only that we had to choose\nthe one that we chose before. Instead of rho,\nyou could have chosen mu as repeating variable\nand rho could have been chosen as non repeating\nvariable. The one, I mean, delta pl here,\nwhich was to be found, should always be in\na non-repeating variable, otherwise your equation\nwill become implicit and that is what we do\nnot want. If there is something on both on\nthe left hand side and the right hand side\nit does not help. So, the best thing to do\nis, to keep the dependent variable as one\nof the non repeating variables.\nNow, the step 7 is, you have to check all\nthe resulting pi terms to make sure that they\nare dimensionless. That is an important step.\nSo, here we check again, we actually have\ndone the same steps, I mean, and same checking\nof this term in this, I mean, last lecture.\nSo, we can see, Pi 1 is F to the power 0 L\nto the power 0 T to the power 0 and similarly,\nthis is also 0. This is step 7. So, both Pi\n1 and Pi 2 are dimensionless.\nNow, in the end, express the final form as\na relationship among Pi terms and think about\nwhat it means. So, the final step is Pi 1\nis a function of Pi 2, Pi 3. Here, we have\nonly 2 so we can simply write; Pi 1 is a function\nof Pi 2. So, Pi 1 is a function of Pi 2, or\nwe can simply write in a reverse format as\nwell, D delta L rho V square is equal to,\nif this is dimension, so 1 by this is also\ndimensions so we have written this and this\nis as I told you, is the Reynolds number.\nSo, important message here is pressure drop\ndepends on Reynolds number and as you see,\nwe have obtained this result, an important\nresult that the pressure drop depends on the\nReynolds number using dimensional analysis.\nSo, I hope at this by this point in time,\nyou would be appreciating how powerful dimensional\nanalysis can be for a future, you know, aspiring\nexperimentalists this is one topic which you\nmust understand, otherwise it is impossible\nto carry on the experiments.\nNow, there are some rules or guidelines for\nchoosing variables for Buckingham Pi theorem.\nSo, one of the as I said one of the most important\naspect of dimensional analysis is choosing\nthe variables important to the flow, however,\nthis can be very difficult. So, in a very,\nyou know, big problem, large problem, there\ncould be many, many variables. Now, the challenge\nis, how to choose the variables which are\nmore important to the flow than the other.\nThe guideline is, we do not want to choose,\nwe should not choose so many variables that\nthe problem becomes cumbersome. If we choose\nhundred variables then the problem will be\nlarge, you know, I mean, it is very difficult\nto even solve it using dimensional analysis.\nSo, to be able to do that we use engineering\nsimplifications. . So, what does this do?\nWe obtain in this first order results sacrificing\nsome accuracy, but making study more tangible.\nSo, while choosing these variables, we have\nfound out that most of these variables will\nfall into one of these 3 categories, most\nof them, geometry, material property and external\neffects. So, best is to, you know, choose\ncarefully. So, all the variables should be\nfalling, but this is only guideline, every\nproblem is different, but most, more or less\nmajority of the problem will satisfy these.\nExternal effects. What are external effects?\nExternal effects denotes a variable that produces\nchange in the system like pressures, velocity\nor gravity. These are external effect. So,\nby definition, it denotes variable that produces\na change in the system. What are material\nproperties? Material properties; it binds\nthe relationship between the external effects\nand fluid response. For example, the viscosity\nand density of the fluid can be listed under\nmaterial properties.\nGeometry; it is the lengths and angles usually\nvery important and obvious variables, these\nmost common one. You cannot neglect, that\nfor example, the diameter of the pipe in our\ncase.\nAs I said, we must choose the variables such\nthat they are independent. There is no point\nin choosing all these 3, mu, nu and rho, we\nshould not be choosing all 3 of them. We can\neither choose nu or rho, or mu and rho, or\neven in some case, mu and nu, but preferably\nmu and nu and rho. Because why I am saying\nthis, because these are not independent, mu\nis equal to rho into nu, this is the formula.\nSo, because of this relationship, they are\nnot independent, all 3 of them, for instance.\nSo, f p, q, r…u, v, w is equal to 0, this\nis one equation. And q can be written as,\nf 1 of say u, v, w, for example. Then u, v\nand w are not necessarily in f, if they only\nenter the problem through q, or q is not necessary\nin f. So, we must not, you know, put it in\nboth places, both in f or q. So, that is one\nof the other way of saying that it should\nbe independent. So, either you enter the variable\nu, v and w through q, or enter it through\nf here, in this one.\nSo, we will start with a question, another\nquestion. So, the time period T of the water\nsurface waves is known to depend on the wave\nlength lambda, depth of the flow D, density\nof the fluid rho and acceleration due to gravity\ng and surface tension sigma. So, using the\nBuckingham Pi theorem, obtained the dimensionless\nform of the functional relationship. This\nis a classical problem of, you know, Buckingham\nPi theorem, which we are going to solve in\nthe class today.\nSo, first, we write down all the variables\nwhich already have been given. It says, time\nperiod T, that is how we have T. We have to\nfind out T and it is known to depend on the\nwavelength lambda, so, lambda is here, depth\nof the flow D. It is our good luck that we\nalready have been told what variable this\ntime period depends upon and so, T is not\nonly non repeating variable, we will see later,\nbut it is also something that needs to be\nfound out, that is why we have written T as\na function of.\nSo, going back again, the time period T depends\nupon wavelength lambda, we have already ticked\nit, depth of the flow D, we have already ticked\nit, density of the fluid rho, acceleration\ndue to gravity g and the surface tension sigma.\nSo, if you see, how many terms are there,\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, total 6 variables are\nthere. Second step is listing all the dimensions\nand that is going to be, so, T is time period\nis time period T. Lambda is, so, this is actually\nlambda is wavelength L and the depth of the\nflow is also L, rho is the density of the\nfluid.\nSo, it can be, what we have chosen, we have\nchosen the basic dimension as M, L and T.\nSo, sorry for this typo, this should be L.\nRho is M L – 3, G is LT – 2 and surface\ntension sigma is MT - 2. So, as we have seen,\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the total number of variables\nis 6. So, n is equal to 6 or k is equal to\n6 and number of primary dimension m is equal\nto, we had been calling in Buckingham Pi theorem\nk= 6 and r as, 3. So, number of Pi terms will\nbe k – r, so total 3 Pi terms.\nSo, some of our steps are complete, we have\ndetermined k = 6 r as 3 and therefore number\nof Pi term is going to be 6 – 3 = 3. These\nare some very, very important steps, this\nmust be followed.\nNow, we have selected, we have to select the\nrepeating variables. So, we have selected\nlambda, G and rho as repeating variable. So,\nif we have, so that is why first we because\nif there are 3 repeating variables. So, Pi\n1 will be multiplied by say first non-repeating.\nSo, T multiplied by lambda to the power a,\ng to the power b, rho to the power c, so this\nshould be dimensionless, Pi 1. So, we have\nwritten down the dimensions, M to the power\n0, L to the power 0, T to the power 0. T is\nT, this T is T, lambda has a dimension of\nL, so, L to the power a.\ng has dimension of LT to the power - 2. So,\ntherefore it is LT minus 2 to the whole power\nb and rho is M L – 3, so M L - 3 to the\npower c. So, if we solve this, we get 1 - 2\nb. Why? See, we have done M. No, we have done\nT. So, T so we have equated the coefficient\nof T, 1 – 2b is equal to 0, this gives b\nis equal to half. Secondly, we have c = 0\nis what we get, if we compute the, so, b equal\nto and we have to calculate a + b - 3 c.\nSo, actually we should be, so the other term\nis going to be so, a, so we will calculate\nb so it will be B minus. So, how are we going\nto get the C is equal to 0 we equate M to\nthe power 0. So, M is only in one term. So,\nM to the power C therefore C is equal to 0\nand to equate you know we have to do for L,\nL to the power so, it will be A - A + B - 3\nC is equal to 0 correct. So, this has been\ngotten for equating \nexponent of T and this has been by equating\nthe exponent of M and the third equation by\nequating the exponent of L.\nSo, these are we get these equal to half c\nequal to 0 and as equal to - half. So, our\nfirst term is going to be T under root g / under\nroot lambda. Now, the second pi term is D\nlambda to the power a, g to the power b and\nrho to the power c, so, these repeating terms\nare the same, of course, exponents we will\nrecalculate. So, we are going to recalculate\nnow because this is not the same and instead\nof T we have put D. So, by inspection, it\nis easy to see that I mean if you do the same\nanalysis as this, you will find out another\nPi 2 terms as d / lambda. Please solve at\nhome.\nThe third is going to be the third repeating\nvariable non repeating variable sigma that\nis the surface tension and lambda to the power\na, g to the power b, rho to the power c and\nthis will same procedure lambda, sorry, sigma\ndimension this is L is lambda, this is g and\nthis is Rho and we calculate it we can get\nc is equal to. There seems to be a problem\n1 +. So, we have done M, 1 + C. So, C will\nbe - 1 for you know and then this is equating\nM , exponent of M , L will be. So, we are\ngoing to equate T, so - 2 - 2 b and this gives\nus b equal to - 1.\nThis is equating T and now if equate L, so\nL to the power a + b – 3c and this will\ngive us a is equal to 3 c - b. So, 3 into\n- 1 - so that will become a is equal to - 2.\nSo, this is also correct. So I will just you\nknow, sorry for the error here. But the calculation\nc should be - 1 and this is computed by equating\nthe exponents of L. So Pi 3 is sigma / lambda\nsquare Rho g, so this is another pi term.\nSo we have found out Pi 1, Pi 2 and Pi 3 using\nthis Buckingham Pi theorem some steps.\nNow, the last step is expressing Pi 1 or any\nPi’s as a function of the other 2. So, this\nis our final result. So, I will like to close\nthis lecture at this point and we will proceed\nin our next lecture. Thank you so much.",
    "video_20": "Welcome back. So, in the last lecture we concluded\nby solving question, by using Buckingham Pi\ntheorem to obtain the time period, here. And\nnow, we proceed back to our discussion of\nhow to be able to choose the variables, in\nBuckingham Pi theorem.\nSo, choosing variables, the first step is;\nclearly define the problem. And we have to\nunderstand, what is the main variable of interest\nor the dependent variable. In just the example\nthat we are solved that the time period was\nthe main, was the dependent variable. And\nin the pipe flow problem that we have done\nbefore there the pressure drop per unit length\nwas the main variable of interest. Now, consider\nthe basic laws that govern the phenomenon,\neven a crude theory that describes the essential\naspects of the system may be helpful, in cases\nlike this.\nNow, you have to start the variable selection\nprocess by grouping the variables into 3 broad\nclasses. With this we have already seen, one\nclass is geometry the other is material properties\nand the third is external effects, that is.\nPlease consider other variables that may not\nfall into one of the above categories. For\nexample, time will be an important variable,\nif any variables are time dependent.\nYou have to make sure to include all the quantities\nthat enter the problem even though some of\nthem may be held constant. For example, acceleration\ndue to gravity, but this should go into the\nproblem. For a dimensional analysis it is\nthe dimensions of the quantities that are\nimportant, not specific values. So, do not\nmiss any of those even though there are constants.\nSometimes we have the tendency of missing\nthe constant, you know, values.\nFor example, as it is mentioned here the acceleration\ndue to gravity, but that has to be taken into\naccount because it is the dimension of the\nquantities that are important and not their\nvalues. You have to make sure that all those\nvariables are independent. Look for relationship\namong subsets of those variables.\nSo, another topic that is uniqueness of Pi\nterm, the Pi term should be very unique. So,\nbefore actually going to this I would like\nto, you know, go and solve one problem here\nthat I have included towards the end.\nSo, the question is, there is a small sphere\nof density rho s and diameter D, that settles\nat a terminal velocity V in a liquid of density\nrho f and the dynamic viscosity mu gravity\ng is known to be a parameter. Express the\nfunctional relationship between these variables\nin dimensionless form. So, what are we going\nto do? We will use Buckingham Pi theorem.\nI just want to solve this problem so that,\nyou know, you are able to practice a little\nmore. So, what we are going to do is going\nto white screen.\nSo, like the problem last time everything\nis given. So, it is given the terminal velocity\nV is a function of, what are function, rho\ns, D, rho f, mu and g. See, if we have missed\nany variable. So, it says, small sphere of\ndensity rho s and diameter D settles that\na terminal velocity V in a liquid of density\nrho f, dynamic viscosity mu and g. So, first\nstep is that we have to list the dimension\nof each variables. So, V is written as, LT\n– 1, rho s will be written as ML - 3.\nI will do it very slow so, that you are able\nto follow, diameter is has a dimension of\nL, rho f will have the same dimension as ML\n– 3, mu will have the dimension of ML - 1,\nT – 1, and g will have LT - 2. So, we have\nlisted the dimensions of each variables as\nfollows. So, K is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so k is\n6 and r is basic dimensions if you see, M\nis also appearing, L is also appearing, T.\nSo, r is 3, which implies hence, there are\n6 - 3 = 3 dimensionless terms. So, these following\nsome of the initial steps we have obtained\nthat there are going to be 3 dimensionless\nPi terms.\nNext step is selecting the repeating variables.\nWe will select D rho f and g as repeating\nvariables. So, first Pi term can be written\nas, so what terms are remaining? V is remaining,\nrho s is remaining and mu is remaining. So,\nthe first term is going to be V into D to\nthe power a, rho f to the power b and g to\nthe power c. So, this is the first Pi term.\nNow, we have to find a, b and c by equating\npowers of M, L, T each to 0 and this we will\ndo in the next page.\nSo, what we write is M to the power of 0,\nL to the power 0 and T to the power 0 is equal\nto LT - 1 this is because of velocity L to\nthe power a, this is because of D, ML - 3\nto the power b because of rho f and g is LT\n- 2 to the power c. So, if we solve this,\nwe see there is only one term for M. So, equating\nM we will get b is equal to 0. Secondly, we\nwill get 1 + a - 3b + c is equal to 0 and\nthirdly, - 1 - 2c is equal to 0.\nThis all together is going to give me, b is\nequal to 0, c is equal to minus half, and\na is equal to minus half. So, the first Pi\nterm that we are going to get is V is to the\npower, V will be V, b is 0. So, what we get\nis V under root g D, so this is the first\nPi term. The second, Pi 2 will be the second\nnon repeating variable, which was rho s. And\nsimilarly D to repeating variable will remain\nthe same, D rho f and g D to the power a,\nrho f to the power b and g to the power c.\nSo, if we solve, you should do this after\nsolving, we can simply get Pi 2 = rho s / rho\nf. You can solve this using the same procedure\ngiven here. Now, the third term, Pi 3 will\nbe the last repeating variable, which was\nmu D to the power a, rho f to the power b\nand g to the power c. So, M to the power 0,\nL to the power 0, T to the power 0 = ML - 1,\nT – 1, L to the power a, ML - 3 to the power\nb, actually I am just writing down, to the\npower c.\nSo, this will give us, 1 + b = 0 - 1 + a - 3b\n+ c is equal to 0 - 1 - 2c is equal to 0 and\nthis will after solving it will give, b as\nminus 1, c as minus half and a as minus 3\n/ 2. So, the Pi 3 is going to be, mu divided\nby D to the power 3 / 2, rho f g to the power\nhalf. So, we have got Pi 1, Pi 2 and Pi 3.\nSo, finally the functional relationship will\nbe Pi 1 V by under root gD is a function of\nPi 2, Pi 3. So, rho s / rho f, mu divided\nby D to the power 3 / 2 rho f g to the power\nhalf.\nThis is one of the, I mean, this is one of\nthe examples where we have solved this. So,\none another problem that we can actually go\nand do this. So, yes. So, another question\nwhich we are going to solve in Buckingham\nPi theorem is question number 6.\nSo, it says that, the efficiency eta of a\nfan depends on the viscosity of the fluid,\nthe angular velocity omega, diameter D of\nthe rotor and the discharge Q. Express eta\nin terms of dimensionless parameters using\nBuckingham Pi theorem as eta is a function\nof omega d square nu / Q / omega DQ. So, here\nalso we are going to use \nBuckingham Pi theorem. So, as always, we will\ngo on a white screen.\nSo, you see, the first step is solution 6\nas in the question number 6 that we have here.\nSo, this eta this is the efficiency of the\nfan is a function of, what all variables have\nbeen told, viscosity nu, omega the angular\nvelocity omega, diameter D of the rotor and\ndischarge Q. So, this is the first relationship\nthat we obtain. The second what we do is we\nwrite the dimensions. So, dimension is M to\nthe power 0, L to the power 0, T to the power\n0.\nNu is L square T - 1, omega is angular velocity\nso it is going to be T - 1, the diameter is\nof course L and Q is L cube T - 1. So, these\nare the basic dimensions that we have written.\nAnd here, how many dimensions are there? k\nis 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And how many basic dimensions\nhave been used here? So, you see, in nu, omega,\nD and Q the dimensions that have been used\nis L and T, there is no mass, it is M to the\npower 0 in efficiency.\nSo, it is only L and T that we have been used.\nSo, r is going to be 2. So, number of Pi terms,\nthis is an example also for you to showing\nthat r is not always 3, 5 - 2 is 3 Pi terms.\nSo, our next step always is, we have to choose\nthe repeating variables. So, the number of\nrepeating variable should be near same as\nr. So, select, we are selecting omega and\nD as repeating variables. So, first Pi term\nis very obvious.\nIf we follow our regular procedure, what is\nthe regular procedure? We multiply the first\nnon repeating with omega to the power a, D\nto the power b. And if we solve this we get\na is equal to 0 and b is equal to 0 implies\nthe first Pi term, implies the first Pi term\nis going to be eta itself ((), very simple,\nyou see that. Now, this second Pi term will\nbe the leftover. So, we can choose the non\nrepeating variable, one we have already chosen\neta is non-repeating variable, the second\nwill be nu.\nNu omega to the power a and D to the power\nb or in other terms, we can write M to the\npower 0, L to the power 0, T to the power\n0 is equal to L square T - 1 into T to the\npower minus 1 whole power a and D is L to\nthe power b. And after equating powers M,\nL and T, what we get is 2 + b is equal to\n0 implies b is equal to minus 2 and minus1\nminus a is equal to 0 implies a is equal to\nminus 1. So, our second Pi term is going to\nbe nu / omega D square. So, that is the second\nPi term.\nSo, now we are going to have the third Pi\nterm. So, Pi 3 can be written as, so, the\nlast one is L 3 T - 1, so that is Q, omega\nto the power a \nand D to the power b or we can write M0 L0\nT0 = L 3 T - 1 into T - 1 to the power a and\nL to the power b and by equating power of\nM, L, T, we get, 3 + b is equal to 0 implies\nb is equal to minus 3, minus 1, minus a is\nequal to 0 implies a is equal to minus 1.\nTherefore, the third Pi term is going out\nto be Q / omega D cube.\nSo, the final expression is going out to be\neta as function of omega D square by nu, or,\nI mean, it is 1 / Pi 2 and Q / omega D cube.\nHence, so, I will go back and solve the last\nproblem for this one, Buckingham Pi theorem.\nSo, there is a question number 10. This has,\nyou know, so and, I mean, the question says,\nan open cylindrical paint can have so, an\nopen cylindrical paint can, one this is one,\npaint can having a diameter D is filled to\na depth h with paint having specific weight\ngamma. The vertical deflection of the center\nof the bottom is a function of D, h, d, gamma\nand E, where d is the thickness of the bottom\nand E is the modulus of elasticity of the\nbottom material. Determine the functional\nrelationship between the vertical deflection,\nand the independent variables using dimensional\nanalysis.\nSo, this is a classical example of, I mean,\nwe can actually go, you know, a little fast\nhere, because in the 2 questions we have clearly\nlaid down, you know, the procedure. So, but\nyou see, even in such complex cases, you know,\nwhere lot of terms, new terms are there, we\ncan use, and we can use Buckingham Pi theorem\nfor this again. So, how we do this is, we\ngo to the.\nSo, we have seen that, according to the solution,\nso, vertical deflection delta is a function\nof D, c h, d, gamma and E. And we can simply\nwrite the dimension, dimension here is length\nL, D is also length and h is also length L,\nd is also length L, gamma is FL - 3 or we\ncan write ML – 2T – 2, E is FL - 2 or\nML - 1 T - 2. So, we have now, we have to\ndetermine the number of required Pi terms\nhere. So, for now we will use F L and T, so,\nthis term.\nSo, we are going to use F L and T as our system,\nnot MLT as system. So, how many variables?\nk = 6, or reference dimension r is how much?\nYou see, in FLT system, it has only F and\nL. So, that means 2. So, number of Pi terms\nis equal to 4. Since, there are only 2 reference\ndimensions repeating variables, let us choose\nD and gamma, one representing L and one representing\nboth F and L.\nSo, the first Pi term, D to the power a, gamma\nto the power b or if we write in terms of,\nyou know, L into L to the power a, F L - 3\nto the power to b is equal to F to the power\n0, L to the power 0. So, this will give, 1\n+ a - 3b is equal to 0 and b is equal to 0,\nresulting in a is equal to minus 1 and b is\nequal to 0. Thus, implying that Pi 1 is equal\nto lambda by d. If we follow same procedure,\nwe are going to get, Pi 2 as h, D to the power\na, gamma to the power b thing and we get Pi\n2, you know, as h / D.\nAnd Pi 3 will be given as, d / D and Pi 4\nis going to be E / D gamma. And therefore,\nwe can simply write, lambda by D is a function\nof h by D, d by D, E by D gamma. So, you can\nsee how we have used the Buckingham Pi theorem\nto solve our problems for dimensional analysis.\nAnd this and with this I will conclude the\nlecture for now and I will see you in the\nnext lecture. Thank you so much.",
    "video_21": "Welcome back to the last lecture of this module.\nWe concluded at the similitude last time,\nwhere we discussed the dynamics similarity.\nAnd we start with the extension of similitude,\nthat is, model scales.\nSo, the fluid flow models are usually designed\nfor one most dominant force and occasionally\nfor 2. Suppose, if the dominant force here\nis gravity then Froude number must be the\nsame in model and prototype. If the dominant\nforce iss viscous force then Reynolds number\nmust be the same in model and prototype.\nSo, we start by solving a problem. The question\nis, for Froude model law, find the ratios\nof velocity, discharge, force, work and power\nin terms of length scale. So, the way, the\nsolution will grow, so, in Froude model law,\nthe model and prototype Froude numbers are\nthe same. That is why, you know, it is called\nthe Froude Model Law. So, Froude in the Model\nm, Fr m will be Vm by under root gL m should\nbe equal to Froude number of prototype is\nequal to velocity in prototype by under root\ngL p. So, very simple.\nSo, if we been, it will be V m / V p is equal\nto under root Lm / Lp, g will get cancelled.\nAnyways, for now, I will take away this. So,\nthe gravity g is same for both model and prototype.\nHence, if the length ratio Lm / Lp is Lr,\nwhat we said here was, Vm / Vp is equal to\nunder root Lm / Lp. So, the velocity ratio,\nVr will be under root Lr. This is what we\nget, they have done the same thing here by\npen.\nNow, the discharge ratio Q r. So, discharge\nratio Qr will be the ratios of velocity into\narea. So, I will just. So, velocity is given\nby Vr and area is the length, I mean, the\nlength whole square. So, Vr we have already\nfound out that Vr was Lr to the power half,\nin the previous slide, multiplied by Lr square\nso it becomes Lr to the power 5 / 2, as indicated\nhere.\nForce ratio. Force ratio will be the ratio\nof densities multiplied by L r square into\nvelocity square. So, ratio of densities we\nsaid was rho r into L r square and Vr was\nunder root L r whole square, so it will be\nrho r L r cube. But anyways I will take this\ndown myself. So, force ratio is going to be\nrho r L r cube, as we just derived. What about\nthe energy ratio? Energy ratio is force into\ndistance, so Fr into L r. So, it becomes rho\nr L r to the power 4. So, rho r into L r to\nthe power 4\nNow, power is force into velocity. So, it\nis force ratio into V r. So, it is force is\nrho r L r cube into V r is under root L r.\nSo, it becomes rho r L r to the power 7 / 2.\nSo, same thing, rho r into L r to the power\n7 / 2.\nNow, there are something called distorted\nmodels. Those were an example with, you know,\nproper modelling, where all the laws were\ntaken into account. There are something called\ndistorted models. So, idea behind similitude\nis that, we simply equate all pi terms. But\nin reality, it is not always possible to satisfy\nall the known requirements so as to be able\nto equate all pi terms. In reality, it becomes\nvery difficult to equate all these terms.\nExample; Study of open channel or free surface\nflows, we will see through an example. So,\nin this case, the Froude number similarity\nwill give V m / under route g m l m is equal\nto V p under root g p l p. And if we have\nthe same gravitational field, just considering,\nthis will give Vm / Vp. So, the ratio of the\nvelocity will be lambda. So, under root of\nlength ratio, that we have seen in the previous\nexample so, under root of length ratio.\nNow, if because both Froude number and Reynolds\nnumber should be the same, if we do the Froude\nReynolds number stability we will have Reynolds\nnumber equated for Model Reynolds number and\nthis is prototype Reynolds number. So based\non that the velocity scale is going to be\nVm / Vp will be mu m / mu p into rho p / rho\nm into Lp / Lm. So, we bring V p down here\nand take other terms that side.\nSince, velocity scale must be equal to lambda.\nSo, we will equate this to lambda r and this\nis already lambda r. So, ratio of kinematic\nviscosity is going to be mu m / rho m / mu\np / rho p is equal to nu m / rho p is equal\nto, this will come this side, because this\nwas lambda r to the power half and this was\nhere, so, it becomes lambda r to the power\n3 by 2. And in reality, it is very difficult\nto find such liquids that satisfy the above\nrelation. So, it might not be always possible\nto find the fluids having this viscosity ratio.\nSo, in practical, ideally, if we can have\nall the type of similarities, that is the\nbest case solution. But in reality, it is\nit might not be always, you know, I mean,\nwe might not be ableto find it all the time.\nSo, to overcome difficulties like before modelling,\nI mean, the one that we did, we have we use\ndistorted scales or distorted models. So,\nwhat is done here? In open channel the vertical\ndimension is used to simulate Froude laws\nwhile the other 2 dimensions are scaled to\nsuit the available space. So, in Froude law,\nin Froude number the vertical dimension so\nbasically, for Froude law we use only the\nvertical dimensional scaling and for the other\n2 Dimension X and Y, we use the geometric\nscaling, for example.\nSo, in distorted scale models, horizontal\nscale length and width is given by L r. A\nvertical scale can be different, in this case\nit can be h r. And ideally, L r should be\nequal to h r, but in distorted models we do\nnot do that. Cross sectional area will be\nthe area in the model divided by area in the\nprototype, if we try to calculate the cross\nsectional area. So, it will be width into\ny divided by B into y p. So, width of model\nby width by prototype is given by the length\nratio.\nWhereas, the vertical cross section y m / y\np is given by h r. So, cross sectional is\ngiven by L r into h r area. So, it is not\na L r square, it is L r into h r.\nFroude number ratio is one. So, this give\nus, F m / F p is equal to 1 and this is V\nm. So, that is what it means, F r is equal\nto 1. So, through this, so implies V m / V\np is equal to under root y m / y p. And what\nis the ratio of y m / y p? Is h r, so, it\nis under root h r, but anyways, we will see.\nSo, V m / V p whole square / y m / y p is\nequal to V r square / h r, another way of\nsolving and we get the same result.\nSo, the velocity ratio is under root of h\nr. Discharge ratio is area ratio and velocity\nratio. Area ratio was L r h r into velocity\nratio is h r to the power half. So, it becomes\nL r into h r to the power 3 / 2. Slope ratio\nis Sm / Sp is equal to its y / x. So, it is\nh r / Lr, one side is the depth, one is the\nx and y dimensions. Time ratio is Lr / Vr.\nSo, L r is L r and V r is under root h r.\nSo, it becomes L r divided by under root h\nr.\nSo, for distorted models find, you know, sorry.\nSo, for distorted models find Manning’s\nratio n r, this is a \nhomework problem for you. So, you can find\nand post your solutions in the forum. So,\nfor distorted models only you have to find\nthe Manning’s ratio. So very simple if you\nknow the Manning’s number formula, you will\njust look it up.\nSo, we are going to solve one problem. In\na tidal model it is given, that the horizontal\nscale ratio is 1 / 500. So, horizontal scale\nratio is L r is 1 / 500 and the vertical scale\nis, so that means, h r is 1 / 50. What model\nperiod would correspond to a prototype period\nof 12 hours. Very good question and we will\nsee how do we solve this problem. So, horizontal,\nas I wrote horizontal scale Lr is given by\n1 / 500 and vertical scale h r is given by\n1 / 50.\nSo, time ratio is L r / under root h r. We\ncan also see that from the previous slide\nformula for distorted, previous slide formula.\nSo, it is L r / under root h r. L r ratio\nis 1 / 500 and h r is, under root hr is 1\n/ 50. So, this comes out to be 0.01414. Now,\nthe time ratio is given by T m / T p and this\nT r we already know. And it says that the\nprototype period of 12 hours which implies\nTm will be T p into T r. Prototype is 12 hours\ninto 16 minutes into 60 seconds multiplied\nby Tr, Tp in seconds.\nAnd this when you multiply, it will give model\ntime period of almost 610 seconds. So, this\nmeans a model second of 610 seconds would\ncorrespond to a prototype period of 12 hours\nin a tidal model. So, this is the problem\nthat we have seen now. So, after that we are\ngoing to solve some problems that relates\nto, you know, these similitude and model scale,\nsome more problems.\nSo, first problem, which we have already actually\ndone in dimensional analysis. So, we go to\nproblem number 2. What does it say? It says\nthat a model boat, 1 / 100 size of its prototype\nhas 0.12 Newton of resistance when simulating\na speed of 0.15, sorry, speed of 5 meters\nper second of the prototype. Water is the\nfluid in both the cases. What is the corresponding\nresistance in the prototype? We can actually\nneglect these frictional forces. So, we will\nstart as always. So, this is question number\n2. We are going to the white screen.\nSo, the resistance offered at the free surface\nis the \nsignificant \nforce and as such Froude model law is applicable.\nSo, Froude model law, Fr m is V m under root\ngl m is equal to V p / gl p is equal to Froude\nnumber in prototype. L r is L m / L p and\nV r is going to be under root L r, that we\nhave already seen using the Froude model law.\nAnd force by model by force by prototype came\nout to be rho r L r square, if you remember\nthe formula, it will be rho r L r cube.\nSo, since same fluid is there, therefore,\nrho r is equal to one. This implies, F r is\nL r whole cube, or in other terms, for F m\n/ F p is equal to L r cube. So, Fp in prototype,\nforce in model divided by L r cube. Now, we\nsubstitute the values, F m is 0.12 Newton\nand this is 1 / 100th L r. So, this is going\nto be, 120,000 Newton or 120 kilo Newton.\nSo, force in prototype is going to be 120\nkilo Newton. This is the answer.\nSo, here you have seen how we have applied\nthis model similitude to obtain the force\nin the prototype. So, we will solve another\nproblem, problem number 5.\nThis is on the same concept. So, the question\nhere states, a proposed model of a river stretch\nof 15 kilometres is to have horizontal scale\nof 1 / 200 and a vertical scale of 1 / 400.\nWhat does this question say? I mean, what\ndoes this indicate? This indicates that we\nare dealing with distorted scales because\nwe have a different vertical scale, sorry,\na different, we have a different horizontal\nscale and a different vertical scale.\nSo, proceeding back to the reading the question,\nif the normal discharge, width and depth of\nthe river are 152 meter cube per second, 90\nmeter and 2 meters, so discharge is 152 meter\ncube per second, width is 90 meter and depth\nis around 2 meter. We have to estimate the\ncorresponding model quantities. What value\nof Manning's roughness n is to be provided\nin the model to represent a prototype roughness\nvalue of 0.025?\nSo, basically, this question will demonstrate\nall the distorted scale, including the Manning's\nroughness question that I gave you to solve\nat home. So, to solve that, I will go to the,\nyou know, white screen.\nSo, I will just write solution 5 here. So,\nwe have been given, so I will just draw a\nline here as well, a horizontals scale, L\nr is 1 / 200, vertical scale, h r is 1 / 40,\nthat is the question. So, first thing to solve\nis discharge. So, Q m / Q p we have already\nfound out, it was Lr into hr to the power\n3 / 2. So, implies Q m is going to be Q p\ninto L r into h r to the power 3 / 2 and Q\np is 152 meter cube per second multiplied\nby 1 / 200 and h r is 1 / 40 to the power\n1.5 and this will give 0.03 meter cube per\nsecond in model.\nSecond thing is depth, y m / y p is h r, simple.\nSo, this implies y m is equal to y p into\nhr or y p here given is, so y p the depth\nwas actually, so I should have actually first.\nSo, I will also write down the known quantities.\nSorry, for this. I will write down the known\nquantities here. Q prototype was given as,\n152 meter cube per second, width was given\nas, 90 meter and y p was given as, 2 meter.\nSo, y p was 2 meter into h r was 1 / 40 and\nit comes out to be 0.05 meter. So, that means\nin model it is 0.05 meter, y m and Q m was\n0.03 meter cube per second.\nNow, the third thing is width, B m we have\nto find. So, B m / B p is the length ratio.\nSo, this implies, B m is, so width is B p\nbasically. So, B m is L r into B p. So, L\nr 1 / 200 into B p was 90 meters. So, B m\ncomes out to be 0.045 meters. So, now, Manning's\nn, this is important. So, Manning's n, n m\n/ n p, you have to find out the formula but\nit comes out to be, h r to the power 2 / 3\ndivided by L r to the power half. This implies,\nmodel n m is Manning's number in prototype\ninto h r to the power 2 / 3 L r to the power\nhalf.\nSo, in the known quantities we were also told\nthe prototype roughness was given, that was\n0.025. So, this is 0.025 into h r was 1 / 40\nto the power 2 / 3 divided by 1 / 200 to the\npower half. So, eta m comes out to be 0.03.\nSo, prototype roughness was 0.025 and the\nmodel roughness is 0.03. So, model here, has\nto be rougher then the prototype. So, if we\nhave seen that everything is reducing the\ndischarge in model has reduced, the y has\nreduced, the depth, the width has reduced.\nBut the special thing to note is that the\nManning’s n or the roughness, so model here\nhas to be more rough than the prototype. It\nis an interesting result, some things to ponder\nover. And with this, you know, I would like\nto finish this module. We have some more questions\nbut we can, you know, take it up in either\nforum if you have come up with anything else\nor in the assignment that you are given. So,\nthank you so much for attending this module.\nI will see you in the next week.",
    "video_22": "Welcome back. So, last lecture at the end\nof last week, we saw that the normal depth.\nWe found out in this particular question was\n1.5 meter. Although the problem in itself\nwas very simple and easy, but the calculation\nwas very complex, but I hope this has given\nyou a good idea. Now, we are going to solve\nanother question, at the beginning of this\nlecture itself.\nAnd it says a trapezoidal channel has a bottom\nwidth of 10 meter and a side slope of 1.5\nhorizontal is to 1 vertical. The Manning's\nn is also given as 0.015. Now, the question\nis, what bottom slope is necessary to pass\n100 meter cube per second of discharge in\nthis channel at a depth of 3 meter. See, in\nall these questions, the formula is Q, the\nwhatever is 1 / n area into R h to the power\n2 / 3. You see what all things are given,\nn is given.\nYou have been given area also because you\nhave been given a bottom width, side slope,\nso area is known. So, everything is known,\nso hydraulic parameters. So, in this particular\nquestion, the it is about finding S 0, this\nis a broader, you know, I mean, a simpler\nway to look at the problem So, what exactly\nis being asked? So, we start doing this question,\nso a trapezoidal channel, very simple. So,\nthis is 10, this is 3, this is 4.5, so area\nis 10 into 3 plus half, base is 4.5 into 3,\nfor this one, and plus same is for this one,\ninto 2.\nSo, area is going to be 43.5 meters square.\nSo, what is given is correct. And the wetted\nparameter, the same thing, this is 10 + 2\ninto whatever this length is. So, this is\n3 and this is 4.5. So, this length we can\nfind out, because I think they have taken\nit in terms of the slope. So, that is where\nthis, but this will come 10 + 2 into wetted\nparameters under root 3 square + 4.5 whole\nsquare and that will come to be 20.81 meter,\nperimeter is also correct.\nTherefore, hydraulic radius is A / P, so 43.5\n/ 20 that is 2.09 meter. So, we have been\nable to find out area, we have been able to\nfind out perimeter, we have been able to find\nout the hydraulic radius.\nSo, by Manning's formula, Q is 1 / n AR to\nthe power 2 / 3 S 0 to the power half. Q we\nalready know, n it is already been told to\nus, area we have already find out, hydraulic\nradius we already found out 2.09 to the power\n2 / 3 by dividing A / R, sorry, A by perimeter,\nS 0 is something we do not know. So, this\ncomes out to be 100 is equal to 4740 into\nS 0 to the power half, and if you calculate,\nS 0 will come out to be 4.451 into 10 to the\npower minus 4.\nSo, this is one question. So, we have seen,\nin Manning's equation we have seen, we were\ngiven everything we were asked to calculate\nQ in one problem. In the other problem we\nwere not given y, so we were asked to calculate\ny, here we have been asked to calculate S\n0. But the procedure is remains the same,\nfirst you find out the area, you have to find\nout the wetted parameter\nP is wetted parameter. In assignments, I will\ngive you the type of questions that will be\nexpected in the exam, as shorter one basically,\nnot taking too much, you know, I mean, complex\nproblems. And then when you know A and P then\nyou find out R h, in every problem, you look\nup the tables or if n is given, you should\nbe able to find out S 0 from either the questions\nor if sometimes it is given.\nSo, we move to the next question. So, a circular\ndrainage pipe of 0.80 meter in diameter conveys\ndischarge at a depth of 0.30 meter. If a pipe\nis laid on a slope of 1 in 900, so we have\nalready been given a slope, estimate the discharge.\nWe have already been given n, now the complexity\nof this problem is that our pipe is no longer,\nour channel is no longer rectangular, it is\ncircular. So, how to deal this problem? So,\nmost importantly, you have to always find\nout the area and the wetted parameter.\nThis is a circular drainage and it will look\nsomething like this. So, the D is 0.8 meter\nand y is 0.30 meter. So, the area of the flow\nsection shown here, you see, this area of\nthe flow section has to be calculated in terms\nof this angle theta. And this will be the\narea of the sector O M N minus area of the\ntriangle O M N. So, if we, for this area if\nwe find out the area of this, which we can\neasily find out in terms of this angle theta\nand subtract this area of the triangle, we\nshould be fine.\nSo, this is how and the same is with the perimeter,\nperimeter we will be able to, this is the\nwetted part and this is the wetted perimeter.\nNow, the question is, how to be able to find\nthat.\nSo, as I said, area of the sector O M N minus\narea of the triangle O M N. So, this sector,\nyou know, area of the sector O M N is very\nsimple, half r square into 2 theta. If the,\nthis is theta, so what is 2 theta? So, if\nthis is theta, this one, so this is 2 theta.\nSo, this is what it has been used here, minus\narea of the triangle is half base into height.\nSo, you see base, this is base into height,\nif this is r. So, this is r sin theta and\nthis is theta and this is r cos theta.\nSo, we get, area as D square / A 2 theta - sin\n2 theta. Also, we know that cos theta can\nbe written in terms of D and y, D is the diameter,\nfor example. So, here we use r 0, but actually\nwe have finally turned this in terms of diameter\nD, cos theta is simply, D / 2 - y. So, if\nthis is y and this is D / 2, so D / 2 - y\nwill be this length, divided by D / 2, this\nis cos theta. Hence 2 theta can also be written\nas 2 cos, inverse of this value. So, this\nbecomes, because y we know, D we know, so\nwe are able to calculate actually 2 theta.\nSo, sin 2 theta is going to be 0.4841. So,\nwe substitute the value, found out the value\nof theta and sin 2 theta also we are able\nto find out\nArea therefore, we are able to calculate for\nthis one, it comes out to be 0.1722 meter\nsquare. Now, what the wetted perimeter is\ngoing out to be? It is simple, it is wetted\nparameter is half D 2 theta; it is so r 2\ntheta. This is 2 theta, we could write, r\n2 theta or D / 2 r 2 theta. So, therefore,\nit is going to be 1.055 meters and the hydraulic\nradius is going to be A / P, which is 0.1633\nmeters. So, hydraulic radius we found out,\nwetted perimeter we found out, area we found\nout, n we already know, S 0 we already know.\nSo, by Manning's formula, Q is equal to 1\n/ n A into R to the power 2 / 3 and S 0 to\nthe power half. If we substitute in the values,\nwe can get Q as 0.1143 meter cube per second,\nvery simple, just that the configuration.\nSo, the catch in this problem was that the\nconfiguration was a little different, other\nthings were fine. So, we proceed to our next\npart.\nSo, there is something called Best hydraulic\ncross section. What is best hydraulic cross\nsection? It is defined as section of minimum\narea for a given flow rate Q, slope S and\nroughness coefficient. So, best hydraulic\ncross section is defined as a section of minimum\narea. So, if we have been given a Q slope,\nS 0 and roughness coefficient n, it is the\nbest hydraulic cross section is the section\nof the minimum area, that has minimum area,\nwhich gives minimum A for all y, for any depth\nit gives minimum area. So, this is the definition\nof the best hydraulic cross section.\nWe will see some questions as well. So, question\nis, the best is to go for this concept through\nsolving a problem. So, question is, obtain\nan expression for the depth of flow in a circular\nchannel which gives maximum velocity for a\ngiven longitudinal slope. The resistance of\nthe flow can be expressed as Manning coefficient.\nSo, we already know that, you know, about\nthe circular channel because we have already\nderived it in the last question.\nSo, for a circular channel of diameter D,\narea is in terms of diameter and theta is\ngiven as, D square / 8 2 theta, from previous\nquestion. Wetted perimeter is simply, D into\ntheta or half D into 2 theta, it does not\nmatter the way you write, but it comes out\nto be from. So, velocity by Manning formula\nis simply, 1 / n R to the power 2 / 3 S to\nthe power half, same formula.\nFor maximum velocity, we have to do d d theta\nof R is equal to 0 hydraulic, you know, radius\nand that means, D of A / P / d theta or P\ndA d theta - A dP d theta. We can actually\nfind A / P but it becomes more complex, so\nthis is much better this is, you know. So,\nP we simply say, D theta and dA d theta will\ncome out to be this, because A we have already\nfound out, A we simply write down and dP d\ntheta will be D and if we solve this, this\nwill give, theta - theta cos 2 theta - theta\n+ half sin theta, this finally will give us,\nsimplification that tan 2 theta is equal to\n2 theta. Now, until this point it is simple,\nbut the solution for this is solved using\ntrial and errors\nAnd if you do that, theta will come out to\nbe, 2 theta come will come out to be 4.4934\nrad. I do not expect you to be able to do\nsolve, you know, trial and error but this\nis the way it is to be done and if you find\nout theta, then y / D is given as, half 1\n- cos 2 theta. So, this is and this was what\nwas required. So, this is one question.\nSo, another question for the hydraulically\nefficient triangular section, we you have\nto prove that the hydraulic radius is y times,\nso this is what we need to prove. So, the\nsolution is, let the side slope of the channel\nbe m horizontal and one vertical. So, area\nis going to be for a triangular channel. So,\narea is going to be, what it is going to be\narea. So, area is going to be, half base into\nheight, 2, 2 cancelled, area will be m y square.\nThat is what is written here and the perimeter\nis going to be very simple, sorry, so perimeter\nwill be this whole.\nSo, it will be 2y. So, if this is m y and\nthis is y, it will be y under root m square\nplus one Pythagoras theorem and the total\nwill be this plus this, so it will be 2y,\nwhich is written and what we have done instead\nof m, m here, we have used this equation from\narea. So, our area comes out to be, A / y\nsquare and perimeter comes out also in terms\nof A and y. So, our unknown here is in A and\ny. For an efficient section what do we need\nto do? We need to have the dP / dy is equal\nto 0. So, to be able to do that we already\nhave this equation, in terms of area.\nSo, we do dP / dy and we obtain minus 2 into\nA e whole square divided by Y e whole cube\n+ 2 y e is equal to 0 and on solving this\nwe get, y e is equal to under root A e, this\nvery simple you know. So, 2y is equal to 2A\ne whole square divided by y e cube, so 2 2\ngets canceled. So, A e square is equal to\ny e to the power 4 so A e will be y e whole\nsquare or y e will be under root A e, which\nis shown here. So, this also means, for efficient\nchannel m is equal to one because we got y\nis equal to under root m. Sorry, we got, A\nis equal to m y square. This will hold true\nwhen m is equal to 1.\nHence, P e is going to be, 2 under root 2\ny e or A e equal to y e whole square, because\ny e is under root A e or A e is y e whole\nsquare. So, in terms of perimeter, you go\nback. So, this perimeter is, A square is,\nso what we got was, A e is y e whole square.\nSo, y e whole square divided by y e whole\nsquare plus, so it is to the power 4 and this\nwill give us, 2 under root y e, 2 under root\n2y e and A e is y e square, this is what we\ngot.\nSo, 2 under root 2y e square or 2 under root\n2 y e. So, this is what we derive. So, A e\n/ P e, that is, hydraulic radius is A e by\nP e. So, these questions are quite simple,\nif you follow step by step you should be able\nto solve these questions very easily.\nSo, this is another question, it sayss that\nthe triangle duct resting on a side carries\nwater with 3 surface as shown in the figure.\nObtain the condition for maximum discharge.\nSo, just telling you for the maximum discharge\ndQ / dy is equal to 0. So, everything is actually\ngiven, so we are going to go a little bit\nquick and, so this is also actually the calculation\nfor this is difficult, but the procedure is\nvery simple.\nBut our objective in solving is not the difficulty\nof the calculation for tests or anything;\nthe calculations are not going to be so complex.\nI want to do it because for this Manning's\nequation and the coefficient, you know, you\nshould be able to handle different type of\ncross section. So, this is the triangular,\nyou know, a different type of cross section.\nFor different m is equal to 0.5 and different\nm is equal to 1.0, we need to find out, you\nknow, maximum discharge.\nSo, the solution is for maximum discharge,\ndQ by dy should be equal to 0. But, Q is,\nwe know, 1 / n AR to the power 2 / 3 and S\n0 to the power half. We know that n and S\n0 is constant, we know that.\nSo, simply, dQ / dy is going to be d dy of\nAR to the power 2 / 3, because n and S 0 are\nconstant or in terms of A and P, if you write,\nR to the power 2 / 3 as, A square to power\n2 / 3 and so A into R to the power 2 / 3,\nlet us, so d dy is the same as, d dy of AR\nto the power 2 / 3 to whole cube. So, it becomes,\nA cube multiplied by A square / P square or\nd dy of A to the power 5 / P square, same\nas what we have written here just I.\nSo, where the area is B – m y into y, if\nyou go and look at, you know, it is very simple.\nThis is the area of submerged and this is\nthe perimeter as well. So, I will just, this\nis the area and this is simple trigonometry.\nSo, you can find out m, this is the area.\nI will take this out and this is the perimeter,\nwetted perimeters, so this one. So, area is\nB – m y into y, perimeter is B + 2y under\nroot m square. You can verify it yourself.\nSo, if we put this here we will get, so from\nthis we get, 5P into dA dy into A to the power\n4 - 2A dP / dy is equal to 0. It is a little\nmore complex actually. And for maximum discharge,\nif you use this, A and P is this, now the\ncalculation becomes very cumbersome. But anyways,\nif you put the value of 1s, when you put in\nthis equation value of m as 0.5 and m as 1,\nyou can see for yourself that this will turn\nout to be equation like this, 5B square +\none point, very complex, but yeah and you\nsolve, this is y is equal to 0.849B.\nSo, it is a quadratic. So, not so complex\nactually but it can be complex, when m is\nequal to 0.1, we get equation like this and\ny will be 0.4378B. For, m is equal to 0.5,\nm is equal to, for m is equal to 1. So, see\nthis question actually is more towards tackling\nall the possible problems for uniform flow,\nManning's equation, wherever they are required.\nAnd I think, that should be the core thing\nthat you must be practicing this week as well.\nWe are going to start with a newer topic,\ngradually varied flow and rapidly varied flow,\nfrom our next lecture. So, we will spend at\nleast 4 at least 3 to 4 or maybe 5 lectures\nthat depends how fast we go. So, this is enough\nfor today's first lecture of this week, from\nnext lecture onword. For this week we will\nbe dealing with gradually varied flow. Thank\nyou for listening and see you in the next\nclass.",
    "video_23": "Welcome students.\nThis is the 7th lecture for this broad topic,\nthat is, open channel flow and as we were\ngoing to start this gradually varied flow\nas promised in the last lecture.\nUntil now, we have studied that in open channel\nflow with the classification based on space,\nthe dimensions, I mean, there are 3 type of\nflows; one is uniform flow and other is non-uniform\nflow.\nSo, non uniform have 2 different categories;\nthe first is gradually varied flow and the\nsecond is rapidly varied flow.\nSo, the next 4 lectures would be dedicated\non these 2 topics gradually varied flow and\nrapidly varied flow, in the open channel flows.\nSo, to get started, we should understand what\nexactly a gradually varied flow is.\nWe have already derived an equation before,\nbut to make it more clear we will see it in\na little different way, a derivation of a\ndifferent sort.\nSo, what is gradually varied flow?\nThe flow in a channel is termed as gradually\nvaried, if the flow depth changes gradually\nover a large length of the channel.\nWe said that, that dy by dx is very much less\nthan 1.\nSo, this is the definition.\nSo, I will just erase this.\nSo, what are the assumptions behind gradually\nvaried flow?\nFirst, that the channel is prismatic, this\nis the first assumption, this means.\nWhat does it mean by the channel is prismatic?\nThat the cross sectional shape, size and the\nbed slope are constant, so this is what it\nmeans, being prismatic.\nSecond assumption is that the flow in the\nchannel is steady and non-uniform.\nNon-uniform means that dy by dx, a steady\nmeans, dy by dt is 0 but dy by dx is not equal\nto 0.\nSo these are the some assumptions when we\ndeal with the gradually varied flow.\nThe third one is the channel bed slope is\nsmall.\nSo, theta or S 0 is small, S0 as we have been\nseen in the open channel flow.\nThe another approximation assumption is that\nthe pressure distribution at any section is\nhydrostatic.\nThis is an important one.\nApart from that, the resistance to the flow\nat any depth is given by the corresponding\nuniform flow equation.\nThis is another assumption when we are going\nto derive the different parameters and the\nproperties of gradually varied flow.\nSo, this is another assumption that the resistance\nto flow at any depth is given by the corresponding\nuniform flow equations.\nFor example, uniform flow equations like the\nManning's equation, for example or Chezy equation.\nSo, example is Manning's equation.\nYou have to remember that in uniform flow\nequations energy slope Sf is used in place\nof bed slope S0.\nWhen Manning's formula is used, we get Sf\nis equal to n square V by R to the power 4\nby 3.\nSo, these we have to, you know, keep into\naccount.\nSo, instead of the bed slope S0, the energy\nslope Sf is used.\nNow, what the going to the differential equation\nof the gradually varied flow.\nSo, first we have to draw, you know, figure\nthe; I have shown you a figure here, where\nthere is a small bed slope, there is a channel\nwith a small bed slope S 0, so basically,\nthis theta is the angle, the datum is given\nby this, you know, this is the datum and the\nheight at any in the height of the bed, at\nany point is at a distance z from the datum.\nThe water depth is given by y, a specific\nenergy E is given here and the energy line\nis given dotted like this and this is the\nwater surface.\nSo, first I will remove this.\nSo, the total energy H of a gradually varied\nflow can be expressed as; so now, there is\na little change from the equation that we\nhave seen.\nIn the uniform flow we have seen, that it\nwas, H is equal to z + y + V square by 2g,\nhere a parameter is introduced, alpha, it\nis a parameter depending upon different conditions.\nIf we assume, alpha is equal to 1 that we\nhave already assumed previously, so when we\nwrote the equation of the total head H in\nany, you know, in any type of flow, we got,\nz + y + V square by 2g, so that was actually\nunder the assumption that alpha is equal to\n1.\nIn principle, we must have this equation;\nz + y + alpha V square by 2g.\nSo, if we assume, alpha is equal to 1, we\nget this equation as first.\nH is equal to z + y + V square by 2g, so the\nvelocity head, plus the pressure head, plus\nthe potential head.\nSo, now if we differentiate both sides of\nthe equation with respect to x, if we do that,\nwe are proceeding in the same way as we did\nin the beginning, so dH by dx is will be dz\nby dx + dy by dx + ddx of V square by 2g,\nthat we call equation number 1.\nSo, now this actually represents the energy\nslope, that is, dH by dx is equal to minus\nSf and this dz by dx represents the bottom\nslope, minus S0.\nThis dy by dx represent the water surface\nslope with respect to the channel bed alright.\nSo, the 3 terms; dh dx represents the energy\nslope, dz dx represents the bottom slope and\nthe dy by dx represents the water surface\nslope, with respect to the channel bed.\nNow, if you see, I mean, for your convenience\nI am just keeping this figure here all the\ntime so, you can actually follow, if something\ncomes I will just point it out.\nSo, further, V square we say d, I mean, just\ngoing into the sub part of that equation,\nfor ddx of V square by 2g, so V square by\n2g can also be written as, V is Q by A, so\nit becomes Q square by 2g A square and this\nis what has been put here, this you should\nbe clear.\nNow, what we do, what we say is, so instead\nof writing ddx of V square by 2g, so let us\nsay this is A, for example, capital A, so\nwhat we write is ddy of A into dy by dx, this\nis a simple differentiation rule that you\nalready know.\nSo, dA by dy can be written as d sorry, sorry,\ndA, so dA by dx can be written as dA by dy\ninto dy by dx.\nSo, same principle we have used here, or we\nsimply write ddx of V square, left hand side\nremains the same.\nNow, looking at the right hand side, what\nwe say is, so Q square is constant, 2g is\nconstant, so it comes out, but we differentiate\nA with respect to the y, so it becomes, so\nlet us differentiate this, I mean, let us\nsee this part, so it will become Q square\nby 2g will be there and when 1 by A square\nwill be differentiated, will become minus\n2 by A cube into dA by dy, this particular\npart.\nAnd then, so this is what exactly is written,\n2 and 2 gets cancelled, this becomes Q square\nby gA cube, you see, Q square divided by gA\ncube into dA by dy and this dy by dx comes\nas it is.\nSo, this dA by dy, rate of change of area,\nwith respect to the depth is called T, where\nT is the top width of the channel.\nSo, we are trying to obtain an equation in\na slightly different form than what we have\nseen before.\nSo, here T is the top width of the channel,\nso this equation can be rewritten as, so if\nwe rewrite equation 1, the dH by dx was minus\nSf, dz by dx was minus S0, this dy by dx is\nthe same and this becomes Q square T by gA\ncube, from the previous slide and this dy\nby dx.\nEach term you have understood now, so we rearrange\nand we take this S0 on this side and dy by\ndx we take common, so let me do it for you\nhere and then you will follow.\nSo, dy by dx, so basically, so I am taking\nS0 this side, so this becomes, and Sf will\nbe the same is equal to dy by dx common, 1\n- Q square T by gA cube, so dy by dx is going\nto be S0 - Sf divided by 1Q square T by gA\ncube, this is exactly same as this.\nSo, it is written in a more, you know, so\njust directly we have written, but now we\nhave shown also.\nSo, this equation is a differential equation\nof gradually varied flow.\nWe have actually obtained the same equation\njust that we did not have T and it was not\nin form of T and A, if you remember, I can,\nyou know, take you to that particular slide,\nso \nI will show you, where we had done that.\nSee, we have obtained this similar equation\nhere, you remember, this one, so it is of\na same form just that we will later see in\nthe gradually varied flow, this is actually\nFroude number whole square, the way of derivation\nwas different.\nSo we go back, we were here, so actually this\nvalue, Q square T by gA cube is Froude number\nwhole square, where Fr is the Froude number.\nSo, you can try, Froude number whole square\nis equal to V square by gy.\nSo, it will be Q square by A square into gy,\nso if you multiply A, this one, this one,\nso it will be Q square A divided by A cube\ng into A, sorry, into y.\nSo, A by y is can be written as T, top width.\nSo, Froude number whole square is Q square\nT by gA cube because Froude number is V by\nunder root gy.\nSo, you have also seen that yg Q square T\ninto gA cube is Froude number whole square.\nSo, this equation is the same as we obtained,\nwe obtained was S0 – Sf 1 minus same.\nSo, now the classification of flow profiles.\nWhat are the flow profiles in gradually varied\nflow?\nSo, if the flow rate Q, Manning's number n\nand S0 are fixed, then the normal depth y0\nand the critical depth yc is also fixed.\nYou understand this?\nSee, Q is equal to 1 by n A, sorry, I will\njust, sorry, the Manning’s equation is V\nby n S to the power 1/2 Rh to the power 2\nby 3 alright.\nSo, S0 is fixed, n is fixed, V is there, then\nQ, you know, depending upon the cross section,\nQ by A that is also going to be, you know,\nfixed.\nSo, this normal depth y0 and the critical\ndepth yc is also fixed, if we know all these\n3 values.\nSo, this is the depth, y0 is the depth which\nis obtained from the uniform flow equations.\nSo, there could be 3 possible relationships\nthat may exist between the normal depth y0\nand the critical depth yc.\nOne, that the normal depth can be greater\nthan the critical depth.\nSecond is that the normal depth is less than\nthe critical depth.\nAnd the third one is that the normal depth\nis the same as the critical depth.\nFurther, y0 does not exist when, I mean, there\nwill be no y0, if the channel bed is horizontal,\nthat means, S0 is equal to 0.\nThe channel if it has an adverse slope then,\nalso there will not be any normal depth, that\nmeans, S0 is less than 0 and based on these,\nthe channels, so based on these, you know,\nconditions the channels are classified into\n5 categories, the channels itself.\nOne is mild slope, that is called M, where\nthe normal depth y0 is greater than the critical\ndepth.\nSo, this implies that the flow is subcritical\nat normal depth.\nSee, Fr is equal to V under root gy0, if y0\nis greater than critical depth, then Froude\nnumber is going to be less than 1.\nSo, if the normal depth is greater than the\ncritical depth, that is, subcritical flow\nat normal depth, then this is called mild\nslope.\nA steep slope is when y0 is less than yc,\ny0 means normal depth is less than the critical\ndepth.\nHere, there will be supercritical flow at\nnormal depth.\nHow?\nFr is V by under root gy0, if y0 is less than\nyc, that means, the numerator is decreasing,\nsorry, denominator is decreasing therefore,\nthis will increase, so this is going to be\ngreater than 1, so that is it is supercritical.\nAt critical slope, this is called the critical\nslope C, so mild slope is denoted by M, a\nsteep slope is denoted by S and critical slope\nis denoted by C.\ny0 is equal to yc, indicates that at normal\ndepth, there is a critical flow alright.\nThe horizontal bed means S0 is equal to 0\nthat is very simple to understand, horizontal\nbed means S0 is equal to 0.\nAnd then in the adverse slope S0 is equal\nto 0.\nSo, using all the conditions before, there\ncould be 5 different type of channels; one\nis mild sloped channel, steep slope and critical\nslope.\nAnd when the normal depth does not exist,\nin that case it is simply defined either as\nthe horizontal bed because there is going\nto be no normal depth in horizontal bed.\nAnd also in the case of adverse slope, when\nthe slope is less than 0, so in that case\nalso there is not going to be any normal depth,\nso it is just defined based on S0 itself called\nhorizontal bed and adverse slope.\nMild slope, steep slope, critical slope, horizontal\nbed and adverse slope, M, S, C, H and A, so\nthis is important to remember.\nThe mild is where y0 that the normal depth\nis greater than the critical depth, steep\nis when the normal depth is less than the\ncritical depth, horizontal bed is very clear,\nadverse slope is also very clear and critical\ndepth is the easiest one to remember.\nSo, this 2; the horizontal bed and adverse\nslope cannot sustain uniform flow.\nSo, the lines which represents a critical\ndepth called CDL and the normal depth is called\nNDL, when drawn in longitudinal section, divide\nthe flow space into following 3 regions, we\nare going to see.\nRegion 1 is, so at the critical depth if we\ndraw that line in the longitudinal section\nat like this, this, you know, then that line\nwhich represents the critical depth is called\nCDL and the one that represents the normal\ndepth is called NDL.\nSo, for example, just I will draw this for\nexample, this is there, this is a channel,\nfor example, I mean, does not even necessarily,\nso suppose this is, this could be anything,\nso this represents line 1, this is line 2,\nso actually it is going to divide into 3 regions,\nregion 1, region 2, region 3, so that is what\nwe are actually talking.\nWe will show you the exact, you know, these\nNDL, HDL, in upcoming slides, but just to\ntell you why there are, you know, the several\nregions.\nSo, region 1 is the space above the topmost\nline, very normal as I showed you, region\n2 is the space between the top line and the\nnext lower line and region 3 is going to be\nthe space between the second line and the\nbed or the lowermost region.\nSo, these are the 3 regions depending upon\nwhere the CDL and NDL is.\nSo, this is an example we have just, I mean,\nthis diagram number 1, I mean, indicates in\ncase of a mild slope, it shows 2 regions.\nWhat was the criteria?\nThe normal depth, so this is normal depth\nand this is critical depth, so this is the\nline that shows, NDL corresponds to normal\ndepth, CDL corresponds to critical depth.\nSo, this represents a mild slope.\nSo, as you see, this is region 1, this is\nregion 2 and this is region 3.\nSo here, this figure represents a steep slope.\nWhy?\nBecause the critical length yc, critical depth\nyc is greater than y0, so CDL is above NDL.\nThe third region is critical slope, so CDL\nand NDL are same.\nSo, here, there will not be any region 2,\nso region between the CDL and NDL is called\nregion 2.\nSo, basically there is going to be 2 regions;\nregion 1 and region 3.\nThe fourth is horizontal bed, there will be\nno NDL here, so there is only be a CDL because\nthe bed is horizontal.\nSo, there is not going to be, there will be\nonly region 2 and region 3.\nSimilarly, here, in case of adverse slope\nalso, there is not going to be existence of\nNDL, only CDL will be there, so that existence\nof only region 2 and region 3.\nSo, this has been, this figures have been\nadopted from Subramanya, Flow in Open Channels,\nthis book.\nI think it is a very nice book for open channels,\nso of course, very detailed, might not be\nfully, you know, this is only one 6th of the\ncourse this open channel flow.\nSo, I mean, you can read these topics from\nthere that will give you a good idea.\nSo, there can be 3, you know, as we have already\nseen that the profiles, there is mild slope,\nthere is steep slope, there is critical slope,\nthere is horizontal bed and the adverse slope.\nSo, depending upon the 3 regions, you know,\nthere could be 3 different types of profiles.\nIf, y is greater than, so region 1 is called\nM1, region 2 is M2, you know, region 3 is\nM3, same S1, S2, S3, C1 and C3 and this one\nis H2 and H3 and this adverse slope is A2\nand A3.\nThis is very clear, because if the y is located\nboth above the normal depth and the critical\ndepth M1, if it is located in between, it\nis M2.\nSo just by region, region wise, you see, these\nregions here, and so on.\nHere, H2, H3, A2, A3 and this is C1 and C3,\nC1 and C3.\nSo, mild slope, this is a figure showing mild\nslope, we have already drawn this.\nThe steep slope, which presents like this,\nyou see, the CDL, the NDL, you see, S1, S2,\nS3, this is horizontal asymptote.\nSo, critical slope, so the horizontal asymptote\nC1 and C3, so I mean, there is much more detail\nto it but at undergraduate level only what\nwe had, I mean, what I am teaching is only\nrequired, the identification of the regions,\nwhat is mild slope, what is adverse slope,\nwhat is horizontal bed.\nSo, the horizontal bed is like this, you know,\nthis area is H2 and this area is H3.\nSo, if the profile is like this and if the\nprofile is like this, which is H2, so the\nprofile is like H2, this is H3, which is just\nto show you.\nAdverse slope looks something like this, which\nyou already know.\nIf, the water level is like this, it falls\nin A2, if this is in this one, below CDL,\nit is A3.\nSo, this all figures have been taken from\nSubramanya.\nSo, I think this is nice and appropriate point\nto stop.\nSo, we will solve couple of problems in our\nnext lecture, for related to the gradually\nvaried flow and then we will continue to the\nother topic called the rapidly varied flow.\nSo, thank you so much for listening.\nI will see you in the next lecture.",
    "video_24": "Welcome back students to this lecture. Last\ntime we left of by finishing the classification\nof different type of slopes; mild slope, steep\nslope, critical slope, horizontal bed and\nadverse slope.\nAnd now, we are going to solve some questions,\ncouple of problems on this topic. So, the\nquestion is; find the rate of change of depth\nof water in a rectangular channel, which is\n10 meter wide and 1.5 meter deep, when the\nwater is flowing with a velocity of 1 meters\nper second. So, the channel is 10 meter wide\nand 1.5 meter deep and the velocity of the\nwater that is flowing is 1 meters per second.\nThe flow of water through the channel of bed\nslope 1 in 4000, is regulated in such a way\nthat the energy line is having a slope of\n0.00004. See, we have been given S0, we have\nbeen given Sf and other things, you know,\nthe velocity and so what we have to find is,\nfind the rate of change of depth of water,\nso we have been asked to calculate dy by dx.\nSo, now you understand, most of the other\nthings are given, very, you know, in the last\nlecture what we have studied we are going\nto use that. So, the best is to go to the\nwhiteboard.\nSo, we are going to see the solution. So,\nwhat things we have already been given? Given\nis, b is given as 10 meter, depth we have\nbeen given 1.5 meter, we also have been given\nvelocity of the flow 1 metres per second,\nbed slope also has been mentioned; 1 in 4000,\nso 1 by 4000 is the bed slope, we also have\nbeen given the slope of, Sf is also given,\nthat is, 0.00004.\nSo, this is quite a simple thing. First, what\nwe need to do? We need to calculate the area\nof the flow and that is nothing but b into\ny, so 10 into 1.5 and that is going to be\n15 meter square. So, we solve, we will go\nvery systematically, T is the top width is\nnothing, top width is, you know, b, that is,\n10 meter, discharge is area into velocity,\narea is 15 meter into velocity is 1 meters\nper second, so that is 15 meter cube per second.\nSo, we have been given y, we have been given\nb, we have been given when, so we have been\ngiven V, S and Sf, so we calculated A as 15\nmeter square, top width is anyways given already\n10 meter and Q is we calculated 15 meters\ncube per second. So, what is the equation\nin the gradually varied flow or in any type\nof flow that we have derived? We have derived\nthat dy by dx, this is the equation that relates\ndy by dx to the some number.\nSo, we have been asked to calculate dy by\ndx, so this is the thing that we need to find\nand the equation was dy by dx is equal to\nS0 - Sf divided by 1 - Q square multiplied\nby T divided by g into A cube. So, dy by dx\nis going to be, S0 is 1 by 4000, Sf is 0.00004,\nso 1 - Q is 15, so it will be 15 square into,\nT is 10, divided by, g is 9.8 and then A cube,\narea is also 15, so 15 cube.\nSo, if you calculate that dy by dx will come\nout to be 2.25 into 10 to the power – 4.\nWill this have any unit? No unit. So, if you\nsee, the slope dy by dx is very, very small,\nwe can say much less than 1, so this is in\nfact. So, I will write here, this is in fact\na gradually varied flow. So, we go back, see\nthis is, so dy by dx came out to be, sorry,\n2.25 into 10 to the power – 4. So, I will\nerase this and I have included the solution\nhere as well, so that, so same thing.\nThese were the things that were given, area,\nthe same thing which we have worked out in\nthe screen. So, the same formula dy by dx\nis equal to S0 – Sf and this is what we\nare going to get. So, this was the final answer\nwhich we have seen on the white screen.\nSo, now we are going to look at another problem.\nSo, the question is, a rectangular channel\nwith a bottom width of 4 meter and a bottom\nslope of 0.0008 has a discharge of 1.5 meters\ncube per second. In a gradually varied flow\nin this channel, the depth at certain location\nis found to be 0.30 meter. Assuming the Manning's\nn is equal to 0.016, determine the type of\ngradually varied profile.\nSo, see, we have been given, the bottom width\n4 meter, here, slope S0 is given, Q has also\nbeen given and we have been given y as well,\nManning's number is given. So what type of\nthe gradually varied profile will it be? So,\nthat we are going to see, and it will be a\nvery, very good practice for you, when you\nstart, you know, applying the things that\nyou have learned in this particular question,\nabout the mild slope, steep slope and adverse\nslope, critical slope and the horizontal bed.\nSo, as I will go to the white screen.\nSo, to start, this Soln means solution, so\nwhat are the things that are given to us,\nyou know, so I will write. So, given is, b\nis equal to 4 meter, y we have been given\nas 0.03 meter, this y is given, Q has been\ngiven as 1.5 meter cube per second, S0 is\nalso given 0.0008 and Manning's roughness\nis also given, 0.016. So, now, capital Q by\nb is 1.5 divided by 4 is 0.0375 meter cube\nper second per meter, so this is small q.\nSo, in the normal, I mean, you remember, the\nway we calculated the critical depth yc was\nq square by g to the power 1 by 3, if you\nremember the formula from our lectures last\nweek. So, this is going to be 0.0375 whole\nsquare by, g is 9.81, and whole to the power\n1 by 3. If you do this calculation using your\ncalculator or, you know, by hand, this is\ngoing to be 0.243 meter. So, critical depth\nwhich we have got is 0.243 meters.\nWhat is the other thing that we need to find?\nSo, we can use the Manning’s equation and\nsee, 1 by n A into R to the power 2 by 3 into\nS0 to the power 1 / 2. So, we see, area we\nalready know, so if in this is a rectangular\nchannel, so this is the y and this is b, so\narea is b y0 already, because if the, if we\nalso need to calculate the normal depth, so\narea is going to be by0.\nSo, using, and these hydraulic radius will\nbe A by P, so here it is actually 4y0, so\na radius, hydraulic radius will be 4y0 divided\nby 4 + 2y0. So, if we use all these value\nin this equation here, so Q is 1.5 given,\nis equal to 1 by 0.016 is n, A is 4 into y0,\nradius, hydraulic radius is 4 y0 divided by\n4 + 2 y0 and this whole to the power 2 by\n3 and then multiplied by S0 to the power ½,\nS0 is given 0.0008 to the power 1/2.\nSo, this can, will actually give us, y0 to\nthe power 2 by 3 divided by 4 + 2y0 to the\npower 2 by 3 is equal to 0.0842. So, if we\nsolve this, you can use any method and you\nwill, we will obtain y0 as 0.426 meter. So,\nthe normal depth we have calculated using\nManning's equation. Is that true? Because\nthat was the thing that we started with, so\nyc came out as 0.243 and the normal depth\ncame out to be 0.426.\nNow, if you see, we were talking that if there\nis, you know, if there is a horizontal bed\nthere is not going to be any normal depth.\nAnd see why we were saying that? We were saying\nthat because if S0 is equal to 0, then this\nQ, there is no existence of Q as such according\nto this equation. Also, when the slope was\nadverse, so S0 is less than 0 then, this means,\nS0 to the power 1/2 is a real, is an imaginary\nnumber.\nSo, concentrating yc is 0.243 and y0 is 0.426,\nso first thing, since normal depth is greater\nthan yc, this is going to be an M slope, first\nof all, M slope channel. Now, the water depth\nis actually 0 point, so actually water depth\nis not 0.03, which I wrote, it was 0.3 meter,\nhere. So, we see this, the y0 is greatest,\ngreater than y and so this is critical depth,\nthis was 0.426, this was 0.3 and this was,\nyc was 0.243.\nSo, which type of curve? This is an M slope\nplus, since y lies between y0 and yc, it is\ngoing to be M2 curve. So, this is a good example,\na very simple and good example, indicating\nhow you have to find the type of the GVF profile.\nSo, this came actually to be M2 curve. I will\njust erase this. So, this is actually 0.3\nmeter, because the depth is 0.3 meter, so\nthis is a typing error.\nSo, similarly we have this again a typed solution\navailable. I think I will just correct this\none when I provide you with the course material,\nso these are the things that were given. So,\nsimilarly we have calculated small q and critical\ndepth is calculated like this, you see, this\nis small q has been calculated, the same way\nit came out to be 0.243 meter.\nSo, now using the Manning's equation, we estimated\nthe normal depth y0 and this y0 came out to\nbe 0.426. Since, it is y0 is greater than\nyc, it is a mild slope and y is greater than\ny0, let us say, it is called M2 curve.\nSo, we have another question; a wide rectangular\nchannel has a Manning's coefficient of 0.018.\nFor a discharge intensity of 1.5 meters cube\nper second per meter, identify the possible\nvalues of gradually varied flow profiles produced\nin the following break in the grade of the\nchannel. S01 is 0.0004 and S2 is going to\nbe 0.016. So, this actually is a good question,\nso we will, so because in this topic we have\nless number of questions, so I think it is\nbetter to solve it here, white screen.\nSo, the solution shall go like this, so discharge\nintensity \nis small q is equal to 1.5 meter cube per\nsecond per meter, so yc we will find by small\nq square by g to the power 1 by 3, very simple\nformula, must be remembered actually, by 9.8\nto the power 1 by 3 and that is going to be\n0.621 meter. So, for normal depth what do\nwe use? Manning's equation, so for wide rectangular\nchannel, so it is, so wide, so hydraulic radius\nbecomes y0 itself, for a wide rectangular\nchannel.\nSo, why? You have you must have a question,\nwhy. So, hydraulic radius is A by P, so by0\nis A, P is b + 2y0, if it is wide, that b\nis very much, much greater than y. So, b +\n2y0 will more or, because it is very wide,\nso this will be, b + 2y0 will be approximately\nequal to b, so this b, b and b gets cancelled.\nThat is why we say normal depth therefore,\nnormal depth for wide rectangular channel,\nthe radius, the hydraulic radius is normal\ndepth itself.\nSo, now, we use this formula, q is equal to\n1 by n y0 into y0 to the power 2 by 3 into\nS0 to the power 1/2, you can also use that\nformula, capital Q, but I find it by using\nsmall q much better, so we can do, so y0 can\nbe written as n into q divided by under root\nS0 to the power 3 by 5, so this implies y0\nis going to be, n is we just substitute in\nthe value 0.018, small q was given as 1.5\nand this under root S0.\nSo, the question is, so actually, we can draw\na table here that says slope and y0, so 1,\n2, 3 and 4, so there are 3, you know, there\nare slope 0.0004, 0.016 and then there is\na critical slope, because this is the critical,\nso for this S0, the normal depth if we put,\nwe can get, this is the 1.197 and if you put\nS0 as 0.016, we are going to get 0.396 and\nyc is 0.612, there are 2 normal depths y01\nand y02 here, here.\nSo, one we put 1.197, the other is going to\nbe 0.396, so this is what is written. So,\nif you go from 1 to 2, you know, since y0\nhere, this one, is greater than yc, this is\nmild slope, first one. But in the second case,\nthe y0 is less than, second case y0 is less\nthan yc, so basically this is the steep slope.\nSo, the resulting M2 curve on mild slope and\nS2 curve on steep slope.\nBecause the water depth is also, you know,\nit is here, so the type of grade change is\nmild to steep. So, basically, until this,\nis fine. So, we have included the solution\nagain here for your convenience.\nSo, now we start with rapidly varied flow\nand then it is almost to the end, but we will\nstart with some concept of the rapidly varied\nflow. So, you see the figure here and what\ndo you notice? See, if you see, there is something\nthat is coming with a velocity V here and\nsomehow this height is larger, I mean, this\nseems that there is something which is different\nfrom this area, so the velocity becomes V2,\nmaybe the height has increased or there is\na bump or something.\nSo, in that case, the flow becomes, so it\nvaries very rapidly. Suddenly, if there is\nsomething, the rapid change in the water level\nelevation or some water level elevation, it\nis called rapidly varied flow. In this particular\ncase, this there is a hydraulic jump due to\nthe change in bottom elevation. We are able\nto source, we are able to say that because\nwe know it from before. This is the photograph\nfrom probably one of the experiments.\nSo, that was a fair introduction to rapidly\nvaried flow. You now, understand what, you\nknow, hydraulic jump is one type of rapidly\nvaried flow.\nSo one; if you see a flow like this, if there\nis a flow coming in this direction and the\narea suddenly increases that is the rapidly\nvaried flow that happens due to the transition.\nSo, first was due to the height, the second\none was due to the, this one is due to the\ntransition, so changing the area, transitioning\nfrom smaller area to larger area, for example.\nSo, now, the most famous type of rapidly varied\nflow is called hydraulic jump. So, this is\nthe concept that becomes the core of our next\n2 lectures and we will start the next lecture\nand with this particular concept, hydraulic\njump, go through a small derivation and solve\nsome problems which will give you a better\nunderstanding of hydraulic jump. So, this\nis all for now. I will see you in the next\nlecture. Thank you.",
    "video_25": "Hydraulic Engineering\nProf. Mohammad Saud Afzal\nDepartment of Civil Engineering\nIndian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur\nLecture – 36\nNon-Uniform Flow and Hydraulic Jump (Contd.)\nSo, welcome back.\nWe just started the topic hydraulic jump,\nat the end of our last lecture.\nSo, we are going to continue with that hydraulic\njump.\nHydraulic jump is a type of rapidly varied\nflow and for rapidly varied flow, the definition\nis dy by dx is approximately equal to 1.\nThis means, that the rate of change of depth\nwith the stream wise direction is not very\nsmall.\nSo, the flow depth changes occur over a relatively\nshort distance, that is the meaning of dy\nby dx approximately equal to 1.\nOne such example, as I said before is hydraulic\njump.\nSo, these changes in depth can be regarded\nas discontinuity in free surface elevation.\nSo, dy by dx can go to infinity as well, so\nif the depth over a small distance if it changes\nrapidly, it can be said that these are sort\nof a discontinuity in free surface elevation.\nSo, hydraulic jump results when there is a\nconflict between the upstream and the downstream\ninfluences that control particular section\nof the channel, so there is a conflict between\nthe upstream and the downstream influences.\nSo, suppose this is a channel, the flow is\ncoming like this and there is some influence\nhere, because of which there is a discontinuity,\nfor example, in the free surface.\nAnd because the water depth changes very rapidly,\nthis is called hydraulic jump.\nThis hydraulic jump can occur due to many\nreasons.\nOne of them is sudden elevation bump that\ncan occur or due to several other phenomenon\nthat we are going to see in this lecture.\nSo, one of the examples is a sluice gate,\nso sluice gate is a gate like this, this requires\nthat the supercritical flow at the upstream\nportion, downstream portion, so sluice gate\nrequires supercritical flow at the upstream\nportion of the channel, whereas the obstruction\nrequire the flow to be subcritical.\nThough this phenomenon called hydraulic jump\nprovides the mechanism to make this transition\nbetween the 2 types of flows.\nSo, one of the most simple hydraulic jump\noccurs in a horizontal rectangular channel\nas below, we are going to see the one of the\nsimplest occurrence of hydraulic jump.\nSo, this figure has been taken from Munson,\nOkiishi and Young's book Fluid Mechanics.\nSo, if there is a flow that is coming like\nthis, in this direction and the water surface\nelevation due to the influence rises like\nthis, then this is the simplest most case\nof hydraulic jump.\nThis we are going to derive the equation for\nhydraulic jump and we will take the help of\nthis particular figure.\nSo, the flow within the jump.\nSo what is the area within, what is this within\nthe jump?\nSo, this is the jump, this is the jump area,\nso the flow within the jump is complex but\nit is reasonable to assume that flow at section\n1 and 2 are nearly uniform steady and 1D.\nSo, one of the approximations is, however\nthis is a jump and this area, this flow is\nquite complex in nature, but we can assume\nat sections 1 and 2, so this is 1 and 2 and\nthe control surface that we have assumed starts\nat section 1 and goes like this and finishes\nat section 2.\nSo, this is the control surface that we have\ntaken.\nSo, at section 1 and 2, we are taking the\nflow to be nearly uniform, steady and one-dimensional\nin nature.\nWe have to neglect any wall shear stress within\nrelatively short segments between the sections.\nSo, we neglect the wall shear stress tau w,\nfor the derivation of the hydraulic jump.\nSince, the at section 1, the flow is nearly\nuniform, steady and 1D, the pressure forces\nthat either section will be hydrostatic.\nThis is another assumption.\nThis is one assumption and this is the, the\nfirst assumption is that at sections 1 and\n2, the flow is considered to be uniform, steady\nand one-dimensional.\nSecond, is we have to neglect any wall shear\nstress within relatively short segments between\nthe sections.\nThe third assumption is that the pressure\nforce at either section is hydrostatic.\nSo, we have seen what the control volume is.\nSo, the x moment, x component of momentum\nequation for control volume is written as,\nso F1 – F2, the difference in the hydrostatic\npressure can be written as, rho Q V2 – V1.\nSo we go back to our original diagram and\nsee what exactly we are talking.\nI will take away this ink.\nSo, this pressure F1 and this is also hydrostatic\ndue to \nhydrostatic pressure.\nSo, this F1 – F2 is the, this F1 – F2\nwill be rho Q \nflow rate into V2 – V1.\nHow do we you remember, where did we get this\nequation from?\nReynolds transport theorem or momentum equation\nthat we derived in week 2.\nSo, now, so rho Q, so Q is, Q can be written\nas, A1 V1 is equal to A2, sorry, A2 V2.\nSo, A1V1 is V1 y1 into b, where b is the width,\nmultiplied and V2 – V1 is the change in\nthe velocity, I mean, the difference of the\nvelocities between section 2 and 1.\nSo, instead of, so we can actually use this\nequation here.\nNow, we need to determine F1 and F2.\nSo, how to determine F1, F2?\nThis is a simplified diagram of the hydrostatic\npressure that we have drawn, the force due\nto the hydrostatic pressure, if you remember.\nWhere, F1 can be given as, rho c1 pressure\nat the midpoint into A1, so this will be gamma\ny1 by 2 into y1b, you see here, 1/2 base into\nheight.\nSo, F1 will be gamma y1 square b by 2.\nSimilarly, because pressure at c1 is gamma\ny1 by 2, similarly F2 is going to be pressure\nat c2 is, 1 and 2 denote the section \nin the control volume, where Pc2 is gamma\ninto y2 by 2.\nHere, b is the channel width, as I told you\nbefore.\nSo, this equation, momentum equation, therefore,\ncan be written as, so you see, so if you,\nlet us try substituting it here and this one\nhere.\nSo, this will be gamma y1 square b by 2 - gamma\ny2 square b by 2 is equal to rho V1 y1 b into\nV2 - V1.\nSo, b will cancel from both side \nand this gamma can come down, so it will become,\nthis gamma can come down here, so Rho by gamma\nis going to be g.\nSo, using this we have simply written y1 square\n- y2 square is equal to V1y1 by g into V2\n- V1.\nSo, this is one equation that we get.\nSo, if we use the conservation of mass that\nis the continuity equation, it will give us\ny1b1V1, A1 V1.\nSo, A1 V1 and this is A2, this we have already\nactually written before also, is Q \nand the energy conservation, so we have applied\nmomentum conservation, we have applied continuity,\nnow we will write energy conservation.\nSo, between point 1 and 2, y1 + V1 square\nby 2g is equal to y2 + V2 square by 2g + hL,\nthis is the energy loss because in the rapidly\nvaried flow, there is going to be some energy\nloss, because of the transition from one flow\nregime to the other or because you see it\nis a very complex process, so we assume there\nis going to be an energy loss.\nSo, as I told, hL is the head loss, so we\nhave 1 equation, 2 equation and 3 equation.\nThe matter is we have to solve this, so that\nwe are going to get some, you know, some definitive\nresults for y2 and y1.\nSo, it is, we know, that head loss is due\nto violent turbulent mixing and dissipation\nthat occurred during the jump.\nAs I said the phenomenon of the hydraulic\njump is quite complex, it is phenomenon where\nviolent turbulent mixing so, vigorous turbulent\nmixing is there and because of that dissipation\nof heat, I mean, dissipation in terms of heat\nwill occur, so energy is going to be lost\nduring this jump.\nFor the equations written behind, you know,\none of the obvious solution is y1 is equal\nto y2 but this implies that there is not going\nto be head loss.\nTherefore, implying that there is no jump,\nso this is a not an acceptable solution to\nus.\nBecause we are assuming that there is going\nto be a jump.\nSo, one of the solution is y1 is equal to\ny2 which we neglect.\nIn a second case, another solution is, if\nwe combine equation 19 and 20 to eliminate\nV2, you go back and see, what equation 19\nand 20 is, we can eliminate V2 and write everything\nin terms of V1.\nSo, using these 2 equation, we can write,\nsee, this is equation number 19, sorry, yeah\n19.\nSo, y1 square - y2 square by 2 is the same\nas left hand side, V1 y1 by g is equal to,\nso here you remember, there was a V2 term,\nthis one, this term, so using the continuity\nequation that y1 V1 is equal to y2 V2.\nSo, we have written V2 is equal to y1 V1 by\ny2.\nSo, instead of V2, we have used the equation\nnumber 20 here, and this will become, so we\ncan take 1 V1 outside as well and y2 also,\nso I will just.\nSo, how to go from here to here?\nI will just solve it out, y1, sorry, V1y1\nby g and let us take from this side, V1 outside,\nthis becomes y1 by y2 - 1 and this is equal\nto, now try to multiply up and down both by\ny2, so we multiply y2, both side.\nSo, this becomes, so we still, V1 y1 by g,\nso this becomes V1 square.\nNow, y1 by y2 into y2 by, no, we do not multiply,\nso this one is okay, V1 square y1 by g by\ny1 by y2 – 1, this we have, so we take y2\noutside, so V1 square y1 by g and we take\ny2 outside, so this is y1 minus this becomes\ny2 and this is same as this equation.\nSo, this equation, you see, can be rewritten\nas, y2 by y1 whole square + y2 by y1 - 2 Froude\nnumber 1 whole square is equal to 0.\nYou see, because Froude number 1 is V by under\nroot gy1, V1, so Froude number 1 whole square\nis V1 square by gy1.\nSo, we try to put V1 square by gy1 in this\nequation.\nSo, if we multiply by 1 here, it becomes y1\nsquare, so this can be written as, this part,\ncan be V1 square by gy1 into y1 square by\ny2 into y2 – y1, so this is Froude number\n1 whole square.\nAnd when this goes, this goes inside, this\nbecomes 1, y1 by y2 and let us and yeah, so\nthis y2 whole square when multiplied here,\nwill also be divided here, so this will become\ny1 by y2 whole square and this becomes minus\n1 by 2 is equal to Froude number whole square\ny1 by y2 whole square into 1 – y1 - y2 and\nthis on rearranging will come out to give\nthis equation.\nSo, this is a simple equation, which using\nthe only the momentum continuity can be derived.\nSo, now you see, this is a quadratic equation\nin y2 by y1 and Fr1 here, is the upstream\nFroude number.\nSo, there is a question which says obtain\nequation 21c from equation 21b.\nSo, very simple, I have showed you most of\nthe steps before, here in this lecture.\nHow to do that?\nYou have to just do some rearrangement, so\nyou try this at home and we can discuss that.\nSo, the for, so this is a quadratic equation\nand this will give us a result y2 by y1 is\nequal to 1/2 - 1 + - under root 1 + 8 Fr1\nwhole square.\nSo, this is the solution of the equation.\nSo, we neglect the solution with the minus\nsign.\nLet me just, so we neglect the minus sign,\ntherefore, we get final solution as, y2 by\ny1 is equal to 1/2 – 1, see because negative\nsolution is neglected because this will give\na negative value of y2, which is not possible.\nSo, that minus sign is neglected so this is\nthe final solution.\nAnd what we, so using energy equation after\nwe have got y2 by y1, we can obtain the head\nloss hL.\nAnd this is completely, so if we are able\nto find y2 by y1 from this equation, see what\nhappens is when the condition at upstream\nis always known, we would most of the time\nknow what the discharge is, what the velocity\nis, where the height of the, you know, water\nis at the upstream end.\nWe would want to find out the situation after\nthe hydraulic jump has occurred.\nSo, in most of the cases y2 and V2 and those\nthings are unknown.\nSo, y1 is known, using this formula, we can\nalso find y2 or y2 by y1, so this is known,\nthis is known, Froude number at 1.\nSo, if we know everything at section 1, so\nFroude number at 1 is also known.\nWe have already find y2 and y1, so head loss\ncan be calculated using this formula and this\nformula has been got, has been derived by\nputting values in energy equation, simple.\nSo, I think this one, these 2 formulas are\nvery important to remember.\nSo, I would suggest you to remember those,\nthese formulas because they would prove very\nhelpful in the questions about the hydraulic\njump.\nSo, this is a graph that has been drawn.\nSo, this is a graph showing, y2 by y1 against\nthe Froude number at 1.\nSo, if you keep plotting, this is hL by y1,\nthis is an area where there cannot be any\npossible jump, this area.\nAnd if you note this particular one, there\nis no possible jump when Froude number is\nless than 1.\nSo, that means at upstream flow must be supercritical.\nSo, head loss cannot be negative, since it\nviolates the law of thermodynamics.\nWe go back to this equation, so this head\nloss, it cannot be below this, because it\nviolates the law of thermodynamics.\nSo, this means, y2 by y1 also cannot be less\nthan 1 and therefore, the Froude number upstream\nFr1 is always greater than 1, for hydraulic\njump to occur.\nSo, important message that you must remember\nis that Froude number at section 1 will always\nbe greater than 1, if hydraulic jump is supposed\nto occur.\nSo, if the Froude number is less than 1 upstream,\nthere cannot be, there is no way hydraulic\njump will ever occur.\nTherefore, the flow must be supercritical\nto produce discontinuity called a hydraulic\njump, a very important conclusion.\nSo, these are the classification.\nSo, if Froude number is less than 1, y2 by\ny1 is equal to 1, jump is impossible.\nNow, these are, I mean, you should not worry\nabout this much, you know, but at the undergraduate\nlevel, but here for information, if the Froude\nnumber at upstream is 1 to 1.7, the standing\nwave or undulant jump, if it is between 1.7\nto 2.5, it is called a weak jump.\nSo, as, you know, Froude number at upstream\nkeeps on increasing, the jump becomes more\nviolent and violent, that is an important\nmessage that you must remember.\nSo, you do not need to worry about what is\nthe value of Froude number for oscillating\njump or what is the Froude number for, you\nknow, balance steady jump.\nMain thing is for Froude number less than\n1, there is no jump possible and secondly,\nif the Froude number at upstream section keeps\non increasing, there the while, I mean, the\nrough the jump is going to become more and\nmore violent.\nOther than that 2 formulas, y2 by y1, the\ndepths y2 and y1, in terms of Froude number\nat location 1 is important and also the head\nloss.\nBut head loss you can always if, you know,\ny1 and y2, you can always use the energy equation\nto find out the head loss.\nSo, this is some example of hydraulic jump,\nyou know.\nSo, there is a constriction and when it, you\nknow, falls down, so when S0 is greater than\nS0c and this the water depth increases and\nso basically, when there is \nchange in slope, with respect to critical\nslope.\nSo, this means, when the slope of the bottom\nwas greater than the critical slope and it\ntransits to a region where the slope becomes\nless than the critical slope, then the hydraulic\njump will occur.\nSo, as I said, this is a jump which is caused\nby change in the channel slope.\nSo, this is the submerged hydraulic jump that\ncan just occur downstream of a sluice gate.\nSo, in this, depending also on the flow conditions,\nyou know, I mean, if many things will depend\nupon the velocity and other things but this\ncan occur just downstream of a sluice gate,\nhere.\nSo, there is one question, in a flow through\na rectangular channel for a certain discharge\nthe Froude number corresponding to 2 alternative\ndepths are F1 and F2.\nWe have to show that, F2 by F1 raised to the\npower 2 by 3 is equal to 2 + F2 whole square\ndivided by 2 + F1 whole square.\nWhat do you think this is a question related\nto the hydraulic jump, yes or no?\nSo, this is a question related to alternate\ndepths.\nSo, basically specific energy principle.\nSo, I will, you know, quickly solve this one,\nwhite screen.\nSo, let y1 and y2 be the alternative depths.\nSo, you remember, this alternative depths\nwas a concept that was given in specific energy\nand specific energy, in that case is, should\nbe equal, at section 2 and section 1.\nSo, let us write, E1 or E1 is equal to E2,\nor same thing.\nSo, y1 + V1 square by 2g is equal to y2 +\nV2 square by 2g, so we will take y1 common,\nso it will become 1 + V1 square by 2g, y1\nis equal to y2 1 + V2 square by 2g y2.\nAnd we already know, V square by g is equal\nto Froude number whole square.\nSo, this equation, you know, y1 1 + Fr1 by\n2 Fr2 by 2.\nSo, basically, y1 by y2, can be written as,\n1 plus, if Froude number we just write F2,\nF2 square by 2 F1 square \nby 2, or y1 by y2 is equal to 2 + F2 whole\nsquare.\nSo, F1 and F2 we already know.\nSo, instead of, you know, Q, I mean, we can,\nwe also know that F1 square is Q square divided\nby B Square gy1 cube and F2 square is equal\nto, same thing, Q square divided by B Square\ngy2 cube, just instead of V we are writing,\nin terms of Q and B is the channel width.\nSo, using this one, you know, we can, if we\nuse these 2 equations here and we can write,\nF2 square by F1 square, using these 2 here,\nwill be equal to y1 cube by y2 cube or y1\nby y2 is equal to F2 whole square divided\nby F1 whole square to the power 1 by 3.\nSo, this was cube, so y1 by y2 is equal to\nF2 by F1 to the power 2 by 3 is equal to 2\nby F2 square and this was what we had to prove.\nSo, this was the thing that we had to prove.\nSo, basically, we started with specific, equating\nspecific energy.\nSo, that was step 1 and step 2 was writing\nthe Froude number in terms of Q and obtaining\ny1 by y2, from here, step 2 and obtaining\ny1 by y2, from step 1 and equating those will\ngive us the required.\nSo, this was the thing that we had to prove.\nSo, this was one very simple which was not\nabout hydraulic jump.\nThe questions about hydraulic jump we will\nstart doing in the next, starting from the\nnext class.\nSo, I think this is enough for today and we\nwill start our, probably the last lecture\non open channel flow next time.\nThank you so much.\nSee you in the next class.",
    "video_26": "Welcome back students.\nSo, we start with solving some questions that\nare related to hydraulic jumps, so rapidly\nvaried flow.\nSo, this entire lecture will be dedicated\nto solving some of the basics and a little\nmore complex problems, those type of problems\nwhich you encountered in exams like GATE or\nIES.\nSo, we start with one problem as below, it\nsays that water on the horizontal apron of\n30 metre wide spillway.\nSo, it is 100 feet or, sorry, that is 30 meter\nhas a depth of 0 point, so 0.06 feet is equivalent\nto 0.20 metre and a velocity of 18 feet per\nsecond that means, 5.5 metres per second.\nThe question is determining the depth after\nthe jump, the Froude numbers before and after\nthe jump.\nSo, this is simple application of the formula\nthat we have.\nSo, if you see, in this figure, so the water\nis coming and it is undergoing hydraulic jump,\nand we have to calculate y2, the depth after\nthe jump, so that is y2, Fr1 and after the\njump Fr2, simple.\nSo, we know the conditions here, at number\n1, so it is pretty simple to calculate Froude\nnumber 1.\nWe will go step by step, the way you should\nbe solving to.\nSo, in this question, the conditions across\nthe jump are determined by the upstream Froude\nnumber Fr1, that also we have to find out\nactually.\nSo, Fr1 is given by V1 divided by under root\ngy1, V1 was given 5.5, y1 was given 0.2, you\nsee, 18 feet per second means, 5.5 metres\nper second and this is 30 meter.\nSo, the Froude number 1 comes out to be 3.92\nand this is greater than 1, which means hydraulic\njump will occur.\nAs I said that the upstream flow is supercritical\nand therefore, it is possible to generate\nhydraulic jump, first step.\nSo, in the second step, we obtain depth ratio,\nwe had the formula which said y2 by y1 is\nequal to 1/2 into multiplied by – 1 + 1\n+ 8 Fr1 square.\nFr1 whole square which already we found out\nin the previous slide was 3.92, plug these\nvalues here, so what comes out is y2 by y1\nis 5.07.\nTherefore, y2 is going to be 5.07 into 0.2\nand that is 1.01 metre, so this is going to\nbe 1.01 metre.\nNow, the way we obtain V2 is by equating the\nflow rate.\nSo, A1 V1 is equal to A2 V2, V gets cancel\nout, so V2 will be V1 y1 divided by y2, y1\nwas known from before, V1 was known from before,\ny2 we just calculated using that y2 by y1\nequation of hydraulic jump, so V2 comes out\nto be 1.08 meters per second.\nSo, therefore, Froude number at location 2\nwill be V2 by under root gy2.\nV2 we have calculated here, this was the reason\nwe were calculating V2, for calculating the\nFroude number and this we calculated in the\nlast slide.\nSo, Froude number 2 comes out to be 0.343,\nso this means subcritical flow.\nSo, when the system goes hydraulic, when it\nundergoes hydraulic jump, the supercritical\nflow turns from supercritical turns into,\nthe supercritical flow turns into a subcritical\nflow.\nSo, Froude number is more than 1 and after\nundergoing the hydraulic jump, the Froude\nnumber becomes, I mean, Froude number becomes\nless than 1.\nSo, the flow becomes subcritical so, as it\nis written here it is a subcritical flow.\nNow, we have to also obtain the head loss,\nthat the energy loss.\nWe simply use this equation, total energy\nat section 1 minus total energy minus section\n2, y1 we have, we know from before, V1 we\nknow from before, y2 we have calculated, V2\nwe have calculated.\nAnd after substituting in the values, you\nsee, the head loss, that the energy loss,\nin terms of head is 0.671 metre.\nThis is the most simplest and the most common\ntype of problems in hydraulic jump, which\nare the type of questions, you also will be\nexpecting in your assignments and exams and\ncompetitive exams especially.\nNow, we go to another question, say that prove\nthat the energy loss in a hydraulic jump occurring\nin a rectangular channel is, so we would try\nto obtain head loss directly, in terms of\ny2 and y1.\nIf we know the 2 depths, because sometimes\nin exams, in the objective type, you know,\nexams like IES and GATE, they simply give\nyou y2 and y1 and asked you to calculate head\nloss.\nSo, basically what you must do is, please\nlearn, remember this equation.\nIn this particular question, we are trying\nto derive this, but you must remember this.\nWe will derive this but in objective type\nof exam, it is very difficult to derive, I\nmean, all the time.\nSo, basically, remember this equation.\nSo, the loss of the mechanical energy that\ntakes place in a hydraulic jump is calculated\nby the application of energy equation, Bernoulli’s\nequation.\nIf loss of total head in the pump is hl, then\nwe can write by Bernoulli’s equation neglecting\nthe slope of the channel\nAs y1 + V1 square by 2g is equal to y2 + V2\nsquare by 2g + head loss, this is what we\ngenerally write.\nSo, head loss can be written as, y1 – y2\n+ V1 square by 2g – V2 square by 2g.\nSo, this remains same, so instead of V1 and\nV2, we write in terms of common quantity.\nSo, q can be written as V1 by y1 is equal\nto V2 by y2.\nSo, we write, so V1, so we take out, sorry,\nvery sorry, this equation, erase all, so this\nis the same, so V1 is q by y1.\nOkay, I just wrote the opposite, q by y2.\nSo, this we substitute here and this we substitute\nhere and therefore, this q square we take\nout common and this is 1 by y1 square minus\n1 by y2 square.\nBecause q is equal to V1 y1 is equal to V2\ny2.\nSo, from equation number 21c, or we do not\nneed to remember, V1 is actually q by, so\nyou remember equation, we are putting V1 is\nequal to q by y1, Froude number 1 is V1 by\nunder root gy1.\nSo, this one you see, you go back to the equation\n21c, it is important to show you, so this\none, this is the equation 21c.\nSo, y2 by y1 + whole square + y2 by y1 - 2\nFroude number 1 whole square is equal to 0.\nSo, we can use this y2 by y 1 here, so we\ncan simply write, y1 y2 whole square + y1\nsquare y2 by 4 is equal to q square by 2g.\nSo, this equation becomes, so this q square\nby 2g is equal to this and we put it here.\nSo, we get hl is equal to y1 – y2 + y1 into\ny2 square + y1 square y2 by 4 and multiplied\nby, which will finally give, if you solve\nthis, this is going to give you hl is equal\nto y2 – y1 whole cube divided by 4y1y2,\nan important equation.\nI think you can, there are other ways of doing\nthat as well but I think you should try this\none at home, solving this one.\nSo, we go to another basic question, which\nsays if in a hydraulic jump occurring in a\nrectangular channel, the Froude number before\nthe jump is 10, so Fr1 is 10, and energy loss\nis 3.20 metre.\nWhat is the sequent depths?\nSo, we are talking about y2 and y1 and then\nit asked about the discharge intensity and\nthe Froude number, hl or El, whatever you\nwant to call it.\nSo, to solve this, we will take the help of\nwhite screen.\nSo, the things that are given to us is, Froude\nnumber or F1, let us say is 10.0 and energy\nloss or head loss is 3.20 meter.\nSo, from the formula, you remember, we had\nfound y2 by y1 is equal to 1/2 of – 1 +\nunder root 1 + 8Fr1 whole square, so if we\nsubstitute – 1 + under root 1 + 8 is into\n10 square and it will give us 13.651 and energy\nloss using previous question that I asked\nyou to remember, EL is written as y2 – y1\nwhole cube divided by 4y1 y2.\nSo, if we say EL by y1 is y2 by y1 - 1 whole\ncube divided by 4 y2 by y1.\nSo, EL we know is 3.20 divided by y1 will\nbe 13.651-1 whole cube divided by 4 into 13.651\nand on solving this, y1 is going to be 3.20\ndivided by 37.08, implies y1 is going to be\n0.0863 meter, so 0.0863 meter.\nNow, y2 by y1 we already know, we have found\nout y1, so y2 by y1 came out to be 13.651,\nimplies y2 is going to be 1.178 meter.\nSo, the water level is increasing.\nSo, we have found out y2 and y1, so we also\nneed to find out Froude number 1, that is,\nV1 by under root gy1.\nSo, Froude number 1 we already know, 10 is\nequal to V1 under root 9.8 into 0.0863, implies\nV1 is going to be 9.20 meters per second,\nsmall q is going to be V1 y1, so 9.20 into\n0.0863 is 0.7941 meter cube per second per\nmeter and Fr2 is pretty simple, V2 by under\nroot gy2.\nAnd V2 can be written, in terms of q by y2\nunder root gy2.\nSo, q we have already found out, 0.7941 and\ny2 is, y2 we found out was 1.178 under root\n9.8 into 1.178.\nSo, Froude number 2 is 0.1983, subcritical\nflow after the jump has occurred.\nSo, this is a very simple problem, we using\nthe formulas, so you see, how this formula\nof energy loss is equal to y2 -y1 whole cube\ndivided by 4 y1 y2 is important.\nSo, there is a solution as always here, you\nknow, I have gotten it typed down.\nSo, sequent depth ratio, so energy loss using\nthis one, so after the jump Froude number\nis 9.2, discharge intensity, Froude number\nafter the jump, same as we did it in the white\nboard.\nSo, another question, it says a rectangular\nchannel has a width of 1.8 meter and carries\na discharge of 1.8 at the depth of 0.2 meters.\nCalculate specific energy, depth alternate\nto the existing depth and Froude number at\nalternate depths.\nSo, in the beginning, we do not know what\ntype of question this is.\nThis is a hydraulic jump or not hydraulic\njump but this is a very, this is a standard\nproblem of open channel flow.\nSo, we should start by, you know, writing\ndown what are the things that we know from\nbefore, you know.\nSo to solve this, so what we know, we write\nit down, V1 is equal to 0.20 meter and that\nis the existing depth, area is A1 is By1,\nB is already given, width of 81.8 meter.\nSo, it is 1.8 into 0.2, that is, 0.36 meter\nsquare.\nSo, velocity V1 is simply, Q by A1, Q is given\n1.80 and area we know is calculated 0.36 and\nthis gives us to be 5 meters per second.\nSo, the first part is specific energy; E1\nis equal to y1 + V1 square by 2g, so y1 we\nalready know, plus V, V we have already calculated,\n2 into 9.81, so this comes out to be 1.47\nmeter, so specific energy at 1.\nSo, we have to calculate y2, so let say y2\nis depth alternate to y1 and specific energy\ndiagram.\nI would like to remind you, when we are dealing\nwith specific energy, we found out a cubic\nequation, for a particular Q, there were existing\n3 values of y.\nOne was negative, which is generally neglected\nand the remaining one, y1 and y2 are called\nalternate depths.\nIn this question, one is already given to\nus and we are asked about the other one.\nSo, the best way of solving this is through\nspecific energy.\nSo, we have calculated specific energy at\none point and now, we are going to equate\nthe specific energy at the other point.\nSo, we write E1 is equal to E2, and E1 is,\nso E2 is y2, that we do not know, plus V2\nsquare by 2g is equal to 1.4742 because that\nis E1 which we have already calculated, 1.47\nactually, you will just write it down, it\nis better not going into too much.\nSo, y2 and V2 is what?\nV2 is similar to, you know, Q by A2.\nSo, Q is 1 point, V2 square is Q AQ square\ndivided by A2 square.\nSo, we still write, 2.981 into, that is, 2g\nand then it is 1.8 because all the depth is,\nI mean, B1 into y1.\nSo, this is A square, A2 square, is equal\nto 1.47.\nSo, if you solve for this, y2 will come out\nto be 1.45 meter, you can use by trial and\nerror or you can, you know, it is not that\nbig a problem.\nSo, y2 comes out to be 1.45 meter.\nSo, now, we know y1, we knew y1, now we have\ny2.\nSo, Froude number at first location is going\nto be V under root 9.81 into 0.2, that is,\n3.57 and for this y2, we need to find out\nfirst velocity.\nSo, V2 is going out to be, Q by By2.\nSo, Q is 1.8, B is 1.8 and y2 is 1.45, so\nthis comes out to be 0.69 meters per second.\nTherefore, F2 is V2 by under root gy2 and\nthis comes out to be 0.69 into 9.81 into 1.45,\nthis equals 0.1829.\nSo, F2 comes out to be 0.1829.\nSo, we have found using the concept of specific\nenergy, everything that was required.\nSo, F1, F2, you know, so we will close this.\nHere now, and go to the solutions that which\nwe have solved actually.\nSo, the velocity using the specific energy\nconcepts, the same solution, Froude number.\nSo, this will be of help to you when you revise\nthe course.\nSo, now, we are going to solve one last problem\nof this module and after that we will end\nthis, you know, lecture.\nSo, instead of going to the white board, I\nwill take you through the slides itself and\nso.\nSo, the question is, in hydraulic jump occurring\nin a rectangular horizontal channel, the discharge\nper unit width is 2.5 meter cube per second\nper metre.\nSo, we have been given, I will explain here\nonly.\nThe discharge per unit width, small q we have\nbeen given and we say that y1, we already\nknow.\nNow, it is asking, estimate the sequent depth\nand the energy loss.\nSo, the way it is to be done is, you see.\nWe know small q, depth we already know, so\nthis is the phenomenon, y1, V1, V2, y2.\nSo, q is 2.5 meters cube per meters per second,\ny1 is 0.25 meters, already given.\nSo, small v1, I mean, V1 is q by y1, which\ncomes to be 10 metres per second.\nAnd if we know V1, we can calculate the initial\nFroude number that comes to be 6.386.\nThis means, we definitely will have a hydraulic\njump because, I mean, we will have a hydraulic\njump, we might, because Froude number is greater\nthan 1.\nSo, we know Froude number at location 1 now,\nwe know y1, so we will be easily able to find\nout y2 by y1.\nSince, we know Froude number at location 1\nBy the formula, y2 by y1 is equal to 1/2 -1\n+ under root 1 + 8 F1 square.\nThis we have derived, you remember, and putting\nin the values, you see, Froude number came\nout to be 6.836, other things, y 1 we already,\nbecause we were given that it is 0.25 meter,\nso y2 will come out to be 2.136 meter, which\nis called the sequent depth.\nAnd now, the last part of this is we have\nto find out the energy loss EL.\nAnd the energy loss EL is given by the formula;\ny2 – y1.\nSo, we know y2, we know y1, so we can, we\nare easily able to find out energy loss, just\nin terms of y2 and y1.\nSo, 2.136 - 0.250 whole cube divided by 4\ny1 into y2 and the energy loss comes out to\nbe 3.141 metre.\nSo, this is the final question of this topic\nand with this we finished the module called\nas open channel flow that went on for 2 weeks.\nSo, in the next week we are going to deal\nwith the pipe flow.\nWe are going to go and see the viscous fluid\nflow, we will see concepts about computational\nfluid dynamics and we will close down with\nthe wave mechanics, which is a typical example\nof in viscid fluids.\nSo, thank you so much and I will see you next\nweek.\nBye.",
    "video_27": "Welcome students. This week we are going to\nstudy a module that is called pipe flow, which\nwill go on for another week. This is a very\nlong and important chapters of hydraulic engineering,\nsame as open channel flow. So, this comprises\nof almost one sixth of the portion of the\nentire course.\nSo, to get started, one of the important things\nthat you must know that the flow in the pipes\nare viscous in nature. Therefore, we call\nit viscous flow in pipes. So, an important\nproperty of a pipe flow is that the pipe is\ncompletely filled with water or any other\nfluid, whichever it can be; it can be with\noil or anything, but the pipe should be completely\nfilled with it. Here, the main driving force\nis usually a pressure gradient along the pipe.\nSo, if you remember, in open channel flow\nthe main driving gradient was gravity. But\nhere, it is pressure gradient along the pipe.\nIf you remember, from dimensional analysis,\nwe derived equation for the pressure drop\nper unit length in the pipe. So, you would\nimagine that the pressure gradient along this\npipe delta p/delta x, let us say, if x is\nin this direction, this is very important.\nHere, gravity may or may not be that important.\nBut to define the pipe flow, we said pressure\ngradient must be there.\nSo, these are the 2 figures, there is a flow.\nSo, this is figure, a and this is b. These\nare section 1 and 2 in this pipe. This is\nsection 1 and 2 in this pipe. If, there is\na flow occurring in both the flows, if you\nput the pressure transducers or something\nthat can measure pressure here and here, this\nwill say that p2 is not equal to p1. That\nmeans, there is a pressure gradient, along\nthis length.\nAnd in the second case, the pipe is not completely\nfilled with water and if you see, if it is\nopen, you know, here also the atmospheric\npressure will be there and here also atmospheric\npressure will be there and p1 will be equal\nto p2. So, this is classified as pipe flow,\nwhereas here there is no pressure gradient,\nthe flow is occurring and it has a free surface.\nThat means, it is an open-channel flow.\nSo, this is pipe flow, as I told you, explained\nyou and the figure on the right hand side\nis open-channel flow because it is exposed.\nIt has an exposed free surface to atmosphere\nand the main driving force here was the gravity.\nSo, I will take these slides away.\nSo, now, when the flow in the pipes occur,\nthe important question is, whether it is laminar\nor turbulent flow because that is one of the\nclassification of the flows that we also saw\nin the open-channel flow. Therefore, what\nis laminar and turbulent flow? That I am going\nto explain. So, the figure a, represents a\npipe in which the water is flowing, water\nor any liquid for that purpose and we have\na set for a dye, this is a dye.\nWhat we do is, we drop a little bit of dye\nhere, using this apparatus. You know what\ndye is? It is a coloured thing, that takes\nthe color of the liquid in which it is. And\nwith the velocity, this dye will also start\nmoving d, y, e, dye. So, this is called a\ndye streak. The line, which the dye follows\nis called the dye streak. As you would see,\nso this, the figure number b is the detailed\nfigure of how this dye streak looks like.\nYou see, this a, this b and this c. So, if\nthe flow velocity is less or if the flow is\nlaminar, in case of less velocity there is\nlikelihood, more likelihood that the flow\nis going to be laminar. It will be almost\nlike a streamline, you see, like this. As\nyou keep on increasing the velocity, you will\nsee, there is going to be starting of some\ndisturbance, like this. This is a transitional\nflow and if the velocity increases very high,\nthe flow becomes fully turbulent.\nSo, there will be a lot of fluctuations, like\nthis. So, this is one of the experimental\nsetups in a pipe flow, where you can actually\nobserve the differences between, the physical\nand the visual difference between the laminar,\ntransitional and the turbulent flow. So, it\nhas been found out that for laminar flow,\nthe Reynolds number should be less than 2100.\nThis is an important Reynolds number that\nI expect you to remember.\nSo, for the flow in pipes, the Reynolds numbers\nshould be less than 2100 to be laminar. Whereas,\nfor the turbulent flow, if the Reynolds number\nis greater than 4000, that flow is definitely\nlaminar and for the range in between 2100\nand 4000 Reynolds number, the flow is transitional.\nYou see, this is the u, the velocity in x\ndirection have been plotted, with respect\nto time. So, for laminar flow, it is going\nto be a straight line, very straight line,\nhere.\nFor the transitional flow, you see, there\nare some disturbance, at some point then it\nbecomes straight and then it becomes, so this\nis transitional. The Reynold number has risen,\nbut not that highest so that it becomes fully\nturbulent. And when we plot for turbulent,\nyou see, there are fluctuations right from\nthe beginning, at every point it is like this,\nyou see, here. So, this is a completely turbulent\nflow.\nSo, for laminar flow, it is a well defined\nstreakline and there is only 1 velocity component\nthat is u of i, i means, in x direction. A\nunit vector in the x direction is i cap. So,\nvelocity is u i cap. Whereas, in the turbulent\nflow, the velocity along the pipe is unsteady\nand it is accompanied by random component,\nnormal to the pipe axis. So, first of all\nit is unsteady and it is accompanied by random\ncomponent, normal to pipe axis.\nAnd it the velocity will be the sum in velocities,\nin all the 3 directions and it is going to\nbe u i cap + v j cap + w k cap. That is an\nimportant property of the turbulent flow.\nSo, this is a figure of an experiment. The\nlink I have written, I have not attached the\nvideo because of the copyright issues. But\nthis is an image of the experiment, which\nwas done in the pipe, as I have shown you.\nAnd this has been done with the help of a\ndye. So, what happens is, in this experiment,\nthe water flows through a clear pipe. So,\nthere was a clear pipe and the speed has been\nincreased in steps.\nInitially, the dye is injected through a small\ndiameter tube at the left portion of the screen.\nSo, from here, the dye has been injected.\nInitially, when the speed is low or we can\nalso say when the Reynolds number was less\nthan 2,100 the flow is laminar. If, you watch\nthe full video following the link given, you\ncan see, the flow is laminar and the dye stream\nis stationary. It is like a pure streamline,\none single line.\nNow, as the speed and consecutively the Reynold\nlumber increases, the transitional regime\noccurs and the dye stream becomes wavy. It\nbecomes unsteady and oscillatory laminar flow.\nSo, in transition, you see, there is, you\nwould see in the video that it becomes wavy,\na little bit of, you know, something like\nthis, you know. Whereas, if you keep the Reynolds\nnumber even higher, that is, greater than\n4,000 or what you can do, you cannot control\nthe Reynolds number. just like that. What\nyou do is, you increase the speed.\nSo, if you increase the speed, the flow becomes\nfully turbulent and the dye stream is dispersed\nrandomly throughout the flow. So, you see,\nwe have read in the chapter of laminar and\nturbulent flow, one important property of\nturbulence is dispersion and mixing. So, you\nsee, in this particular video, you will see,\nthat the dye stream is dispersed, in all the\ndirections.\nAnd clearly indicating what we had learned\nin the laminar and turbulent fluid flow chapter,\nin this particular course of hydraulic engineering\nwas correct. We can verify that experimentally\nand by visual investigation.\nNow, there is a question. So, water at a temperature\nof 10 degree centigrade flows through a pipe\nof diameter 1.85 centimeters. Determine the\nminimum time taken to fill a 0.355 litre glass\nwith water if the flow in the pipe is to be\nlaminar. The second part is. determine the\nmaximum time taken to fill the glass if the\nflow is to be turbulent. And we will have\nto repeat the calculation for the same thing\nif the water temperature is 60 degree centigrade.\nWhat we have been given? We know that the\nReynolds number is rho VD/Mu, we also have\nbeen given the rho and mu at 10 degree centigrade\nand we also have been given the rho and Mu\nat 60 degree centigrade. So, this is all the\ninformation that we have for now. So, this\nis the simplest most basic question, but this\nwill help you clarify the idea of laminar\nand turbulent flow in pipes. So, I am going\nto go to the white screen.\nAnd we are going to solve this problem. So,\nlet us start with the 10 degrees’ case.\nSo, we know that Reynolds number is rho VD/Mu.\nD is the diameter of the pipe, rho is 1000\nkilogram per meter cube and Mu is 1.307 into\n10 to the power - 3 Newton second per meter\nsquare, at 10 degree centigrade. So, for laminar\nflow, what was the Reynolds number which was\ncritical? So, for any flow, which was less\nthan 2100 Reynolds number was laminar.\nSo, the question is, determine the maximum\ntime taken to, sorry, determine the minimum\ntime taken to fill a 0.355 liter glass. So,\nwhen will the minimum time be taken? Minimum\ntime will be taken when we have the maximum\nvelocity and maximum velocity that can be\ntaken, in case of laminar flow would correspond\nto Reynolds number of 2100, because that is\nthe maximum Reynold number.\nSo, for laminar flow, Reynolds number we have\ntaken 2100 because the velocity corresponding\nto this Reynolds number of 2100 will take\nthe minimum time to fill the glass is equal\nto rho VD/Mu. So, the \nvelocity is going to be, 2100 Mu/rho into\nD or we can write, 2100 into 1.307 into 10\nto the \npower - 3/1000 into the diameter of the pipe,\nwhich is given as, 0.0185, 1.85 centimeter\nis 0.0185 meters.\nAnd this will give us, 0.148 meters per second,\nat 10 degree centigrade. Therefore, the time\ntaken to fill is velocity, so, sorry, not\nvelocity, volume by and which is 3.55 liter\ninto 10 to the power -3 meter cube and Q is\narea into velocity. What is the area? Pi/4\ninto D square \ninto velocity, which we have got, 0.148. So,\nI think I should write this step again, volume/area\ninto velocity.\nTherefore, if you do this calculation, time\nthat will be taken to, minimum time taken\nto fill will be 8.92 second, if the flow is\nlaminar. Now, the second part, it says is\nwhat is the maximum time taken to fill the\nglass, if the flow is to be turbulent? So,\nturbulent regime starts from Reynolds number\nof 4000. If the velocity is high that means,\ntime taken will be very less.\nBut here, the question is what is the maximum\ntime taken if the flow is to be turbulent?\nSo, the maximum time taken will be, when the\nvelocity is minimum. So, minimum velocity\nrequired for a turbulent flow will correspond\nto a Reynolds number of 4000. So, for \nturbulent flow, minimum time here, maximum\ntime.\nSo, for turbulent flow, the maximum time,\nwe write, 4000 = rho VD/Mu or velocity is\ngoing to be 4000 Mu/rho into D or 4000, Mu\nis 1.307, into 10 to the power -3/rho is 1000,\ndiameter is 0.0185 and this will give us,\na velocity of 0.282 meters per second. So,\nthe time taken will again be volume/discharge\nor volume/area into velocity. So, this will\ncome out to be 0.355 into 10 to the power\n-3/pi/4 0.0185 and the velocity is 0.282.\nSo, the time required, maximum time required\nis going to be 4.68 seconds, max time. This\nwas minimum time. So, you have seen how this\nis calculated. Now, the second part is, we\nhave to repeat the calculations if the temperature\nis 60 degree centigrade. So, I will quickly\ngo through the calculations again. So, first\nI will,\nSo, for 60 degree centigrade water, so I will\njust take the, so for laminar flow velocity\nis 2100 into mu/rho D and therefore, the velocity\nis 2100, mu in case of 60 degree is 4.665\ninto 10 to the power -4 divided by, in density\nwas 983.2 and the diameter remains same. So,\nthis will give us 0.0538 meters per second.\nTherefore, time required would be volume/Q\nand this is 0.355 into 10 to the power -3/pi/4\n0.0185 whole square divided by 0.0538.\nSo, the time required in this, comes to be\n24.54 seconds, so minimum time at 60 degree\ncentigrade. So, for turbulent flow, V will\nbe similar thing, 4000 into Mu/rho D, Mu is\n4.665 into 10 to the power -4. So, 983.2 into\n0.0185 and this will come, the velocity is\ngoing to come 0.102 meters per second. Therefore,\nthe time taken would \nbe volume/discharge. So, volume is 0.355 into\n10 to the power -3 divided by, maximum time\nat 60 degree centigrade.\nSo, this was one simple question that we solved\nwith the application of laminar and turbulent\nboundary values. But rest of the concepts\nof the Reynolds number, what is the formula\nand other things remain the same. So, after\nthis we will go back to our lectures, the\nslides.\nNow, there is an entrance region and fully\ndeveloped flow. We should talk about this\nwhat entrance region is and what a fully developed\nflow in a pipe flow is. So, you see, there\nis a figure here, which I will explain it\nto you later. So, there is a pipe coming out\nfrom the reservoir and the, so this is the\nand this is pipe. So, as soon as the water\ncomes out from the reservoir to the pipe,\nearlier there was no water.\nSo, as soon as this water comes out, the water\nwill take some time to become fully developed.\nWe are going to go into that in a little more\ntime but I will explain you. So, this region,\nthis length le is called the entrance region.\nAnd as soon as the water starts moving the\nboundary layer formation will start because\nnear the wall the velocity is going to be\nalmost to the 0 and the maximum velocity will\noccur along the centre line, as we have already\nseen in the laminar and turbulent flow analysis.\nInviscid core here means that there is no\nviscosity. The viscosity is at the boundary.\nAnd after it has gone through this entrance\nregion le, the velocity becomes fully developed.\nAnd you see, this is the velocity profile\nin the pipe flow that we get, parabolic in\nnature. So, now just going into a little,\nyou know, so what we see is fluid typically\nenters pipe with nearly uniform velocity.\nSo, the velocity with which it enters at section\n1 is uniform velocity. The length of this\nentrance region depends on the Reynolds number.\nSo, how long this entrance length will depend\nupon how fast the water is flowing or in other\nword, the length of the or in the other words,\nReynolds number. So, the dimensionless entrance\nlength is given by le/D = 0.06 Re. Whereas,\nfor turbulent flow, it is given as le/D = 4.4\ninto Reynolds number to the power 1/6.\nThese are the important formulas. So, you\nshould remember them. So, if the flow is laminar\nwe will have a shorter entrance length. Whereas\nif the, I mean, Reynolds number is high or\nthe flow is turbulent, we will have a longer\nentrance length region.\nNow, as the fluid moves through the pipe,\nviscous effects cause it to stick to the pipe\nwall because of the no slip boundary condition.\nAs I told you here, as it starts moving because\nof the no-slip boundary condition, the viscous\neffect will cause it to stick to the pipe\nwall and the boundary layer will grow in thickness\nto completely fill the pipe. Now, the viscous\neffects are of considerable importance within\nthis boundary layer, as we had discussed.\nFor the fluid outside the boundary layer within\nthe inviscid core surrounding the center line\nfrom 1 to 2, viscous effects are negligible.\nAs I said here, this is inviscid core that\nmeans there is no viscosity in this inviscid\ncore. But after the end of the entrance region,\nthe boundary layer shall occupy the entire\npipe and the inviscid core will cease to exist.\nSo, the for fluid outside the boundary layer,\nthat was within the inviscid core surrounding\nthe center line from 1 to 2, viscous effects\nare negligible. The calculation of velocity\nprofile and pressure distribution within the\nentrance region is very complex and therefore\noutside the scope of this course. So, we are\nnot going to calculate the velocity and pressure\ndistribution within the entrance region.\nThe only thing that you should remember is\nwhat is going to be the entrance length, depending\non the Reynolds number.\nSo, as soon as the flow reaches the end of\nthe entrance region, the flow becomes simple,\nmuch more simple and the velocity will be\ndependent upon the radial distance r and the\nvelocity will also be independent of x. What\nis r? So, this is a pipe., so this is x and\nbecause it is a pipe, it is circular, so this\nis r, radial distance from the center line.\nThe flow between section 2 and 3 is called\nfully developed flow.\nSo, I will just take you there again. So,\nflow between this section 2 and 3 is called\nfully developed after this entrance region\nhas ended. And why only until 3? Because at\n3 there is again a bend. So, this is the complete\ndescription of that figure. And I think, this\nis a fine point to stop the lecture here.\nAnd we will start with the pressure and the\nshear stress distribution, in our next lecture\nof this module. Thank you so much for listening.\nSee you in the next lecture.",
    "video_28": "Welcome back student. We are into yet another\nlecture of pipe flow. Last time we finished\ntalking about the entrance region.\nNow, we are going to see what the pressure\nand the shear stress distribution through\na figure, you know, through a graph, in the\nboth the entrance region and the fully developed\nflow region is. So, when the, as you see in\nthis graph, as soon as the water enters the\npipe there will be a pressure drop here and\nthat is called the entrance pressure drop.\nThis is le, as we said and this value can\nbe calculated based on the Reynolds number.\nIf, the flow is laminar, it is 0.06 Re. Whereas,\nif it is turbulent, it is of the order of\nRe to the power 1/6. However, you see, after\nthe flow has become fully developed, the pressure\ndp dx, you know, the pressure drop per unit\nlength becomes constant. So, this has been\nobtained through experimental analysis. So,\ndel p del x = constant. So, important information\nto grasp from this particular slide is that\nin the entrance there is an entrance pressure\ndrop.\nWhereas, when it becomes, the flow becomes\nfully developed del p del x is constant. Here,\nin the entrance flow what happens is, the\npressure is balanced by the viscous forces\nand the acceleration in the entrance region.\nWhereas, in the fully developed flow there\nis no acceleration, no acceleration, therefore,\nthe viscous forces are balanced only by the\npressure drop.\nSo, one thing that distinguishes fully developed\nflow and the entrance flow is that the existence\nof acceleration in the entrance flow region\ncompared to the fully developed flow region.\nNow, the need of this pressure drop. The need\nof this pressure drop can be seen as, in terms\nof force balance, it can be said that the\npressure force is needed to overcome the viscous\nforces generated. In terms, if we want to\nsee why the pressure is needed to be dropped.\nSo, pressure force is needed to overcome the\nviscous force generated.\nWhereas, in terms of energy balance, we can\nsay that the work which is done by the pressure\nforces is needed to overcome the viscous dissipation\nthroughout the fluid. So, these are the 2\ndifferent ways of seeing the need of the pressure\ndrop in the fully developed area and the same\ncan also be applied for an entrance region.\nJust that the instead of only viscous forces,\nit will be viscous forces plus the acceleration.\nSo, now, the problems with the fully developed\nlaminar flow is that the most the, I mean,\nthe basic problem is that in reality, most\nof the flows are actually turbulent. Therefore,\nthe theoretical analysis is not yet possible.\nSecond thing, most of the pipes that we see\nin our network are not long enough to allow\nthe attainment of fully developed flow. Because\nif you see, it was le/D = 0.06 Re.\nIn case of, let us say Reynolds number of\n4000, which is a pretty common, you know,\nthis le and diameter of the pipe, let us say\n1 meter, 0.06 into 4000. So, le becomes 240\nmeters. So, the entrance length region is\n240 meters for a pipe of diameter 1 and Reynolds\nnumber of 4000. Even if the Reynolds number\nis 1000 then also it will require at least\n60 meters length pipe. So, in most of the\ncases, what happens is these pipes are not\nlong enough to allow attainment of fully developed\nflow because for that fully developed part,\nwe can actually do the real analysis.\nBut that will occur only after the fully developed\nregion has occurred, which in most cases does\nnot, because the pipes are shorter in length.\nNow, but what is the importance of the fully\ndeveloped laminar flow? There are certain\nproblems related to it. But there are certain\nimportances and advantages to it, as well.\nIt is one of the very few theoretical viscous\nanalysis that can be carried out exactly and\nthat we will see how in our upcoming slides\nin lectures.\nAnd therefore it also provides a foundation\nfor further complex analysis. There are many\npractical situations which involves the use\nof fully develop laminar pipe flow. We will\nsee those examples later.\nSo, the equation for fully developed laminar\nflow in pipe can be derived using 3 approaches.\nWhat are these 3 approaches? One is from Newton’s\nsecond law, which is applied directly. Second\nis from using the Navier-Stokes equation.\nThe third one is from dimensional analysis.\nSo what we are going to do? We are going to\nstart the derivation of fully developed laminar\nflow in pipe, using Newton’s second law\nnow.\nSo, this is the snapshot of a fluid element\nat time t, this one here. And in the fully\ndeveloped laminar flow this is the velocity\nprofile, as we have seen in our laminar and\nturbulent flow analysis. And this velocity\nis only a function of radial distance r. from\nthe pipe, this is the diameter D of the pipe,\nthis is the x dimension and the fluid element\nis of length l, that we have considered.\nAt time t = t + delta t, so therefore, after\nat any time interval of delta t, this is the\nfluid element. This is section 1 and this\nis section 2. So, you have to keep this figure\nin mind.\nSo, for your easiness I have already kept\nthis figure here, so that you are able to\nfollow the derivation. Now, I will repeat\nwhat I have said again. We have considered\na fluid element at time t, as it is shown\nin the figure above. This element, so it is\na circular cylinder of fluid of length l and\nradius r centered on the axis of a horizontal\npipe of diameter D. Because the velocity is\nnot uniform across the pipe, the initial flat\nend of the cylinder of fluid at time t becomes\ndistorted at time when the fluid element has\nmoved to its new location.\nAnd the reason is, because across the radial\ndistances, the velocity is not constant, it\nis a function of radial distance. If, the\nflow is fully developed and steady, steady\nmeans, that it is not a function of time,\nthe distortion on each end of the fluid element\nis the same and no part of the fluid experiences\nany acceleration as it flows. So, this is\nthe background for the derivation, containing\nimportant information that will be used during\nthe derivation.\nSo, there are some assumptions. The assumptions\nis that the local acceleration is 0 since\nthe flow is steady. We also assume that the\nconvective acceleration is 0 since the flow\nis fully developed. Now, the every fluid particle\nflows along streamline with constant velocity.\nThe neighboring particle have slightly different\nvelocities, because the velocities are a function\nof radial distance r. For now, the gravitational\neffects will be neglected.\nAnd the pressure is constant across any vertical\ncross section of the pipe. So, of course the\npressure varies from this point, to this point,\nto this point, to this point, to this point,\nbut across this cross section, the pressure\nif there is a pressure p here, it will be\np here, it will be p here, p here. So, the\npressure will is dependent, I mean, changes\nonly with the x distance, not with the r distance.\nNow, the pressure dropped delta p = 0 that\nmeans pressure decreases in the direction\nof flow. And that is very true, the water\nwill move from a pressure from the region\nof having high pressure to that having low\npressure.\nSo, this is the figure for that element that\nwe have drawn. So, the force acting from this\nside, if there is a pressure p1, on the left\nside at section 1 and this is section 2 and\nif we assume the delta p is the pressure drop,\nso p will be here, will be p2 is going to\nbe, p1 - delta p. And because of the viscous\nforces, if there is a shear stress acting\ncalled tau, then the force acting F1 will\nbe pi 1 pressure into area.\nSimilarly, the another force will be acting\nhere, F2 p2 into area and this is the shear\nstress force due to shear stress. So, the\nequation is going to be F1 - F2 - the tau\ninto 2 pi rl because this shear stress will\nbe acting on the entire cylindrical parameter.\nSo, F1 is p1 pi r square. So, F1 is this,\nF2 is p1 – delta p into pi r square – t\ninto 2 pi rl = 0. So, just going through,\nit will be p1 pi r square – p1 pi r square\n+ delta p pi r square – tau 2 pi rl = 0,\nso expanding, so this, this gets cancelled.\nSo, we can write, tau into 2 pi rl = delta\np pi r square. So, this r and this r gets\ncancelled, pi and pi gets cancelled. So, delta\np can be written as, so delta p/l, so if l\nwe bring this side, so delta p/l can be written\nas 2tau by, and this r we bring downside here.\nThis is exactly same, as we have written here.\nSo, we get, delta p/l = 2 tau/r.\nSee, the pressure drop per unit length does\nnot depend on, so this delta, sorry, so this\ndelta p/l does not depend upon the radius.\nBecause it is pressure drop per unit length\nand this we call as equation number 1. So,\nyou see, we can say that delta p/l was constant.\nSo, we can say tau is equal to, so we have\ngot 2tau/r is equal to C1 or we can simply\nsay tau = C into r. This is what we can get.\nThis is C1, so but 2C is C1/2. So, tau we\ncan write Cr.\nSo, we see, that at midpoint, at r = D/2,\nthis tau takes CD/2 and that is the maximum.\nAnd that happens where? It happens at the\nwall. Therefore, this shear stress tau, at\nwall is called as tau w wall shear stress.\nSo, if we put, r = D/2 in this equation, see.\nSo, what do we get? So, tau = C into D/2.\nAnd this C is going to be 2 tau w/D. Therefore,\ntau can be written as, 2tau w r into D.\nAnd when we have obtained tau, we can write,\ndelta p because delta p/l = 2 tau/r or 2/r\nor we can write, D/2 here and tau is 2 tau\nw r. So, this r and r gets cancelled, so this\nbecomes delta p/l = 4 tau w/D and delta p\ncomes 4 tau w into l/D, this same equation.\nNow, you would have a question that, how did\nwe get C? So, let us see, just going back\na little bit, you might have a question, how\nthis C becomes 2 tau w / D. How?\nSo, see, we have written, tau = Cr. So, at\nr = D/2, tau = tau w. So, we substitute this,\nin this equation here, we get, tau w = CD/2.\nSo, C becomes 2 tau w / D and this is what\nhas been substituted here. So, we get tau\nas a function of the wall shear stress, 2\ntau w / D into r. So, now, we have obtained\ntau, in terms of wall shear stress. Therefore,\nusing this particular equation, we have obtained\ndelta p.\nSo, these are some of the important results\nto remember. This tau = 2 tau w r /D is equation\nnumber 2. As you can see, the tau is a function\nof r and this pressure drop, pressure drop\nper unit length is constant, as 4 tau w/D.\nSo, this is the profile, you see. So, this\nis the laminar profile for viscous pipe flow\nand this is the ideal profile, you see. This\nis Vc. You remember, in our laminar and turbulent\nfluid flow, we derived this, that Vc was Vc/2,\nthe average, the ideal inviscid profile.\nWhereas, it goes from 0 to Vc and the shear\nstress variation is like this. This is the\nlaminar profile in the pipe flow and the shear\nstress distribution is like this. This is\nsomething important to remember, as well.\nNow, the discussions. Shear stress varies\nlinearly with r and why? If, the viscosity\nwas 0 that there was no shear stress and pressure\nwould have been constant throughout the channel.\nTherefore, a small shear stress can produce\nlarger delta p if the pipe is relatively long.\nThis you have to, you know, know why shear\nstress varies linearly with r. Of course,\nwe have done the derivation but you try to\nfind out.\nSo, you take it as a homework question. Secondly,\nif there was no viscosity, assume let us say,\nif it was, you know, 0 then there would be\nno shear stress and pressure would have been\nconstant throughout the channel. That is true,\nbecause there would be nothing that would\ncause the pressure to work. Therefore, a small\nshear stress, you see this, you see, delta\np is 4l tau w/D.\nSee, this equation and see our conclusion,\nthat a small shear stress can produce large\ndelta p, if the pipe is relatively long. So,\nif l/D is very, very much greater than 1 that\nthen even a small shear stress will produce\nlarge delta p. So, until now, about the analysis\nwe have done is valid for both laminar and\nturbulent flow. At no point in time, we have\nassumed that the flow yet is laminar. So,\nthe assumptions for both laminar and turbulent\nflow is same.\nSo, all the equations, equation number 1,\nequation number 2 and equation number 3 are\nvalid both for laminar and turbulent flow.\nSo, from here onwards, we would assume the\nshear stress distribution for laminar flow.\nSo, from now on in the next derivation, we\nwould assume that the shear stress distribution\nis for the laminar flow.\nSo, for Newtonian liquid, for laminar flow\nthis is the shear stress distribution we have\nseen. Tau is is written as -Mu du dr, you\nremember this. This is what we have got, tau\nis equal to. How did we get this equation?\nWe get this equation from our equation number\n1. So, this is equation 1. So, taking both\ntogether, we can see, see we equate these\n2 and this becomes -Mu du dr = delta p/2 l\ninto r. So, we equate this one and we equate\nthis one.\nSo, du dr can be written as, minus of delta\np/2 Mu l into r. So, if we take dr on this\nside, it will become du = - delta p/2 Mu l\nr dr. Therefore, we can simply write, integrate\non both side, we get u = - delta p/2 Mu l\nwith minus sign and r square/2 + C1. So, finally\nit can be written as, -delta p/4 Mu l r square\n+ C1 and this is the same thing that we have\nwritten here. If, you can follow this.\nNow, importantly, there is 1 boundary condition\nat, so one of the boundary condition is, boundary\ncondition is no slip condition. And where\ndoes it happen? It occurs at the wall. Or\nwall is where? At r = D/2, which means, u\n= 0 at r = D/2. And if we put this, in this\nequation, let us put it, we say 0 = -delta\np/4 Mu l D square/4 + C1. So, what do we get?\nWe get C1 as, delta p D square/16 Mu l. So,\nthis is the value of C1 that we get.\nAnd if we substitute this C1 even here, let\nus do that. So, I rub these. So, u will be\nminus delta p/4 Mu l into r square + C1 is\ndelta p D square/16 Mu l. This r square can\nbe written as, D square/4, therefore, if we\ntake delta p D square/16 Mu l, as constant.\nSorry, so this is not D, this is r square,\nso let me, so this is r square. So, u is,\nso let us take delta p D square/16 Mu l, as\nconstant and then we are left with 1minus,\nso this will be 1 and this will be r square/D\nsquare/4 or exactly same. So this is what\nwe get. So, we have got ur as a function of\nradial distance r.\nSo, the flow rate is going to be, so now,\nwe have determined u as a function of r and\nthe flow rate across the entire pipe will\nbe integral of 2 pi r dr, you see, the area.\nIf, we start integrating at a distance, we\ntake an element of thickness dr, at a distance\nr, we can write, Q will be u integral dA and\nwe integrate from r = 0 to D/2 that the half,\nI mean, the entire radius, we can write, ur\ninto 2 pi r dr.\nSo, integral 0 to D/2, u r was delta p D square/16\nMu l into 1 – 2r/D into 2 pi r dr. And on\nintegration, we will come up with this equation,\npi D to the power 4 delta p/128 Mu l. This\nis the flow rate Q, in the entire pipe. This\nis termed as, equation number 4. And this\nparticular flow rate Q is called the Poiseuille’s\nlaw. So, we have used Newton’s second law\nto derive the discharge rate through a pipe\nas a function of pressure gradient delta p\nand this is Poiseuille’s law.\nSo, this is an important topic, I mean, important\ntopic that this Poiseuille’s law. So, one\nof the, you know, critical one to this laminar\nflow through pipes. So, I think, we will finish\nthis lecture at this particular point. When\nwe meet again in the next lecture, we see,\nhow these laws can be modified if the gravity\nis also present and proceed further with our\nanalysis. So, thank you so much for listening\nand attending today’s class. I will see\nyou in the next lecture.",
    "video_29": "Welcome back student to yet another lecture\nof the pipe flow.\nIn the last lecture we derived the Poiseuille’s\nlaw. The Poiseuille’s law is Q = pi D to\nthe power 4 into delta p/128 Mu l, where l\nis length of the pipe \nand delta p is the pressure drop. So, we have\nbeen able to relate the pressure drop with\nthe discharge. So, proceeding forward,\nWe will now see what if the gravity was also\npresent and that if it can be added to the\npressure. So, it is, earlier our pipe was\nhorizontal, there was no gravity. But right\nnow, the equations of motion will change.\nBecause then there will be another, you know,\nthis w sin theta, that is, pi r square l sin\ntheta w sin theta, this is not in multiplied\nby gamma, gamma pi r square l sin theta will\nbe another component that will be acting in\nthis direction.\nBecause of which our analysis will change\na bit but the what happens is, instead of\ndelta p, we are going to get components like,\nminus rho gl sin theta, in the equation number\n1. When we are going to calculate the velocity,\nminus rho gl sin theta here and the Poiseuille’s\nlaw will change, where minus rho gl sin theta.\nIf, you want to verify, see, this is valid\nfor all the angles. So, if you put theta =0,\nyou see, this term will vanish, this term\nwill vanish and this term, because sin 0 = 0.\nIt will be same as what we have derived before.\nSo, you can also try to remember these equations,\nat least Poiseuille’s law you remember,\nthat is quite important, with or without the,\nI mean, the change in angle, you know, if\nthe gravity is there or not with the sloping\npipe. So, these are the generalized equation.\nSo, now, we are going to solve a question,\nwhich says that an oil with viscosity of 0.4\nNewton second per meter square and density\nof 900 kilogram per meter cube, flows in a\npipe of diameter 0.02 meter. What pressure\ndrop, is needed to produce a flow rate of\n2 into 10 to the power -5 meter cube per second\nif the pipe is horizontal with x1 = 0 and\nx2 = 10 meter? That is the first question.\nAnother question is, how steep a hill must\nthe pipe be on if the oil is to flow through\nthe pipe at the same rate as above with delta\np = 0. And the third, for the conditions of\npart b, this one, if p1 = 200 kilopascal what\nis the pressure at section x3 = 5 meter, where\nx is measured along the pipe. So, this is\nthe question that involves the use of Poiseuille’s\nlaw and also involves the last equations that\nwe have seen, what happens if the gravity\nwas present. So, to solve this, we will solve\nthis in a white screen.\nThe solution 2, the first one. So, if the\nReynolds number is less than 2100 the flow\nis laminar \nand the equations derived before are valid.\nSince, the average velocity is V = Q/A. So,\nQ is 2, into 10 to the power -5 and area is\npi/4, into 0.020 whole square and this comes\nto be 0.0637 meters per second. And how do\nwe write the Reynolds number? Rho VD/Mu and\non putting this you will get Reynolds number,\nthis velocity.\nWe are going to get, Reynolds number of 2.87.\nThis Reynolds number is less than 2100 which\nimplies, hence, the flow \nis laminar and L = x2 - x1 = 10 meter. So,\nfirst we found out the velocity. Checked that\nusing the Reynold number, if it is laminar\nor not. Yes, it was laminar and the pressure\ndrop was p1 - p2 = 128, using the Poiseuille’s\nlaw. So, we are now going to substitute that.\nSo, delta p, I will rewrite the equation,\nis equal to p1 - p2 = 128 Mu lQ / pi D to\nthe power 4. So, delta p is going to be 128\nMu is 0.40, into 10 into 2 into 10 to the\npower - 5/pi into 10 to the power 4. So, pressure\ndrop is going to be 20371 Newton per meter\nsquare or 20.4 kilopascal. This is the pressure\ndrop that we found out using the Poiseuille’s\nlaw. The second part says, if the pipe is\non a hill of angle theta, such that, the pressure\ndrop p1 - p2 = 0.\nSo, for this, we use modified Poiseuille’s\nlaw and we can write, because delta p = 0,\nso we can use sin theta will be -128 Mu Q/pi\nrho g into D to the power 4. So, sin theta\nis going to be -128 this is 0.40, into 2 into\n10 to the power -5 into pi into 900 into 9.81\ninto 0.020 to the power 4 and theta is going\nto be approximately -13.34 degrees. So, in\npart a, we use simple Poiseuille’s law.\nIn the second one, we use the modified Poiseuille’s\nlaw.\nNow, the third part says that with p1 = p2,\nthe length of pipe l does not appear in the\nflow rate equation. So, this is a statement\nof the fact \nthat for such cases, the pressure is all along\nthe pipe. See, for part, b we said there was\nno pressure drop, that is correct. So, that\nmeans the pressure is constant all along the\npipe.\nSince, delta p = 0, p1 - p2 = 0. So, p1 is\nequal to p2. And p2 is equal to how much?\nSorry, p1 = 200 kilopascal, sorry, or yes,\np or 3, sorry. Therefore, p3 is also going\nto be 200 kilopascal, since delta p was 0,\nin part b, very simple, because there was\nno pressure drop per unit length. So, the\npressure would be the same as, what is at\n0. So, we finish this one here. So, in the\nprevious question, we have seen the application\nof Poiseuille’s law and also the modified\nPoiseuille’s law, in presence of the gravity.\nWith this point, we move forward to our second\nway of finding the derived, for finding the\nlaminar flow in the pipes, for fully developed\nflow. But before that we should revise some\nbasic mathematics, for revision and these\nconcerns our mathematical operator. For example,\nthere is an operator called del operator,\nwhich every one of you know, it is del del\nx, del del y and del del z. Now, the Laplacian\noperator is del square that means it is del\nsquare / del x square, del square / del y\nsquare, and del square / del z square. Gradient\noperator, it is del p, it is del p del x,\ndel p del y and del p del z.\nThere is a vector gradient, that is, del u,\ndel v, del w. There is a divergence operator,\nthat is, del dot u that gives del u del x,\ndel v del y and del w del z. These are all\nbasic mathematical equations that you know\nfrom before. There is one directional derivative\nthat u dot del, it becomes u del del x + v\ndel del y and w del del z.\nSo, with this thing we are proceeding ahead\nfor derivation of the laminar flow through\npipes, using the Navier-Stokes equation. So,\nthe general motion of an incompressible Newtonian\nfluid is governed by the continuity equation\nand the conservation of mass. This continuity\nequation is written as, del dot u = 0, this\nis continuity equation. Whereas, the momentum\nequation is written as, this or Navier-Stokes\nequation and this is equation number 8.\nSo, you should remember that for steady fully\ndeveloped flow in the pipe the velocity contains\nonly an axial component, which is the function\nof only the radial coordinates r, that we\nhave talked in the beginning of this chapter\nitself. So, for such conditions, the left\nhand side of the momentum equation becomes\n0, because it is steady. This is equivalent\nto saying that the fluid experiences no acceleration\nas it flows along.\nSo, convective acceleration and everything\nis 0. This is acceleration, local acceleration,\nthere is convective acceleration. The same\nconstraint was used in the previous section,\nwhen we considered F = ma, for fluid cylinders.\nSo, left side of the Navier-Stokes equation\nbecomes 0, because there is no acceleration\nin the flow.\nTherefore, if we write, with g as, minus g,\nin terms of vector, the Navier-Stokes equation,\nso the continuity equation will be del dot\nv = 0 and the right hand side can be written\nas delta p, delta p + rho gk + Mu del square\nV. Now, the flow is governed by the balance\nof pressure, weight and viscous forces in\nflow direction. In cylindrical coordinates,\nwe can simply write, so del p is del p del\nx + rho g sin theta. Whereas, Mu in radial\ndirection 1/r del del r into r del u/del r.\nSo, this is the using the Navier-Stokes equation,\nequation of flow through the pipe \nfor a fully developed laminar flow. So, here\nare the assumptions and the results are exactly\nsame as the Navier-Stokes equation, which\nis derived from the Newton second law, just\nwritten in a more differential form.\nNow, the third way I said was dimensional\nanalysis, from your dimensional analysis module.\nYou remember that pressure is a function of\nV, l, D, and Mu. So, if we take delta p/l\nas a function of V, D, Mu or let us take,\nK is how much, 5, r is, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nSo, K is 5 and r is 3. So, therefore number\nof dimensionless terms will be K–r, that\nis, 2 dimensionless term, so, pi 1 and pi\n2. We get this using dimensional analysis.\nSo, using dimensional analysis we get this\nresult. Now, assuming that the pressure drop\nis proportional to the length, so we say that\nthe D delta p/Mu V is directly proportional\nto the length so it becomes C into l/D. So,\nfrom here, because you might not be, so D\ndelta p/Mu V is some function of l/D, but\nwe say proportional to the length.\nSo, we write, constant C into l/D, this equation.\nTherefore, we can write, delta p/l, l we bring\nthis side, other parameters we take that side,\nit becomes C Mu V/D square or Q = area into\nvelocity. So, area is pi/4 D square. Therefore,\nwe will get, pi/4 into C delta p D to the\npower 4/Mu l, as this equation. Now, you see,\nthere is something, some constant called C.\nWe are going to look into something here that\nis called Darcy’s friction factor. If, we\nrewrite the Poiseuille’s law, Poiseuille’s\nlaw was pi D to the power 4 delta p/128 Mu\nl. Therefore, delta p could be written as,\n32 Mu l V/D square, in terms of velocity.\nNow, if we divide both sides by this side,\nso this is in terms of Q and this is in terms\nof V. So, this is also a form of Poiseuille’s\nlaw.\nIf, you divide both sides by dynamic pressure,\nlike half rho V square, so delta p/half rho\nV square will be 32 Mu l V/D square/half rho\nV square. So, this will be, this half becomes,\ngoes up and become 64 and this we can take\nout, Mu/rho VD into l/D and this Mu rho VD/\nMu is Re. So, basically, we can write, delta\np/half rho V square = 64/Re into l/D. So,\nyou see, we would see later, that this 64/Re\nis termed as Darcy friction factor f. Darcy\nmeans this is for the laminar flow.\nSo, this is often written as, delta p = f\ninto l/D rho V square/2, with this equation\nnumber 10 analogy, we say that Darcy friction\nf for laminar fully developed pipe flow is\ngiven by 64/Re and this is Darcy friction\nfactor f for fully developed laminar flow.\nAnd this is you must remember this.\nThis is equation number 11. So, now in terms\nof wall shear stress, if we use equation number\n3, f can be written as, so equation if we\nuse this f l/D into rho V square/2. If we\nif in terms of wall shear stress using equation\n3 we will get f = 8 tau w/rho V square. This\nis quite simple. Do it as your homework. If\nyou have any problems, you can ask that to\nme in your, in the forum and this is equation\nnumber 12. It is just a matter of equating\nto obtain this, in terms of wall shear stress.\nSo, I think this is a nice point to stop this\nlecture and I will see you in the next lecture\nwhere we are going to continue the topic of\nenergy in fully developed laminar flows.\nThank you so much for listening and I will\nsee you in the next class.",
    "video_30": "Welcome back student to this 4th lecture of\nthe pipe flow.\nLast time we saw the Darcy friction factor\nand we saw that for the fully developed laminar\nflow the Darcy friction was 64/Re. Whereas,\nin terms of wall shear stress, it was 8 tau\nw/rho V square.\nNow, we are going to see about the energy\nin a fully developed laminar flow. So, consider\nthe flow between 2 locations and if we consider\nflow between 2 locations, we can write, Bernoullis\nequation. So, the pressure head, the velocity\nhead and the datum head is equal plus the\nenergy loss on the other side, if there is\nan energy loss, in terms of head loss hL.\nThis alpha and alpha 2, we take 1 for the\nuniform velocity profile and alpha>1 for non-uniform\nvelocity profile.\nWe are assuming, alpha = 1 because our velocity\nprofile is uniform. So, for fully developed\nflow, alpha 1 = alpha 2 = 1. And here the\nhead loss accounts for energy loss, associated\nwith the flow, that I have told you before.\nSo, we have written, Bernoullis equation between\n0.1 and 0.2, accounting for the head loss\nor the energy loss \nand this is due to the viscous dissipation.\nFor inviscid flow, there will be no head loss,\nhL was going to be 0.\nSo, with this background, we will rewrite\nequation number 13. So, we will get, p1/gamma\n+ z1 - p2/gamma + z2 = hL, for uniform velocity\nprofiles. So, what we are going to get, p1\n- p2/gamma = delta p by, because this is if\nwe do p, so here is p1/gamma minus, so we\ncan write, p1 - p2/gamma and this becomes\ndelta p/gamma, z2-z1 we can always write l\nsin theta, the datum, if, the bed, the slope\nof the bed is theta.\nAnd if we put that here, we are going to get,\ndelta p/l – l sin theta = head loss or delta\np – gamma l sin theta/gamma is head loss,\nwith this simple manipulation. Now, if we\nuse equation 5. You remember what the equation\n5 was? Then, so p – gamma l sin theta using\nequation number 5, can be written as, 2 tau\nl/r. This will be the head loss. And then\nhad loss can be simply written as, 2 tau l/gamma\nr. This is equation number 15.\nNow, if we use equation number 2, 2 was using\nthe wall shear stress and using equation number\n2, if we substitute tau, in terms of wall\nshear stress and r, we will see, we will get\nhead loss as, 4l tau w/gamma D. So, this is\na quick formula for obtaining the head loss,\nin terms of wall shear stress, length of the\npipe and diameter of the pipe. So, you should\nremember this one. And this is equation number\n16.\nIt is just a matter of substituting one equation\ninto the other and obtaining what we require.\nSo, the beauty of this equation is that, you\nknow, 4l tau w/gamma D, it depends only on\nthe wall shear stress.\nNow, we have written head loss as 4l into\ntau w/gamma D. This is equation number 16\nand this equation is valid both for laminar\nand turbulent flow. So, we have not yet used\nany approximation, specific for only laminar\nflow. This particular equation, because the\nsubstitution that we have done, we have taken\ntau w and tau relationship, that was, valid\nfor both laminar and turbulent flow.\nSo, with this we conclude this energy in fully\ndeveloped laminar flow and the also this one,\nsince it is valid for turbulent flow and so\nalso energy in the turbulent flow.\nNow, we proceed to a broader topic called\nturbulent flow. Much of it we have already\nseen in a chapter called laminar and turbulent\nflow. But for specifically for pipe flow,\nwe will go through it once again. The one\nthat we have said was for a general case of\nflows, in the week number 3 that we went.\nSo, here there is a figure that shows, time\non this axis and velocity on this axis. You\nsee. as the velocity is increasing until some\npoint, the velocity is less so this is the\nlaminar region. The idea is if you keep on\nincreasing the velocity, Reynold number will\nincrease and the flow will become from laminar\nto transitional to turbulent. So, as you keep\non increasing the velocity until this point,\nit is still transitional until Reynolds number\nof 4000.\nAnd after that it becomes fully turbulent.\nSo, in turbulent flow the axial component\nof velocity fluctuates randomly. The components\nperpendicular to the flow axis appear, you\nsee here. In turbulent flow, heat and mass\ntransfer are enhanced. That is another important\nfeature that we know. In many cases, reasonable\nresult on turbulent flow can be obtained using\nthe Bernoulli’s equation, many cases. For\nbecause the, I mean, by putting a Reynolds\nnumber as infinity.\nSo, talking about the fluctuation in turbulent\nflow, all parameters fluctuate in turbulent\nflow. Whether it is velocity, pressure, shear\nstress, temperature, everything fluctuates\nand they behave chaotically, chaos is there.\nThe flow parameters can be described as an\naverage value plus fluctuation. This we have\nalready seen many times, that u can be return\nas, u bar + u prime, v can be written as,\nv bar + v prime, w can be written as, w bar\n+ w prime, same with pressure.\nSo, this is the average component, things\nwith the bar and this is the fluctuating component.\nAnd these you see, there is bar and prime.\nSo, they can be characterized by turbulent\nintensity and timescale of fluctuation. Turbulence\nintensity is nothing but under root of u prime\nwhole square and then average taken over that\nto the average value. So, you see, here it\nis the fluctuation by average value.\nSo, you can assume, if the fluctuation is\ntoo high, the turbulence intensity will be\nhigh because it is fluctuation by average.\nSo, in terms of wave averaged or, you know,\ntime average, this can be written also like\nthis, so something like this. So, you see,\nwe have plotted again it as a function of\ntime, the fluctuations. So, here it is not\nthe average velocity, it is the fluctuating\nvelocity component, as a function of time.\nSo, this line represents the fluctuation,\nthis solid line. The dash, dash, dash represent\nfluctuation to the whole square and u and\nthis line is the thin line, here, you see,\nso this is the fluctuation, the tick line.\nWhereas, this line, represents u dash whole\nsquare and this, the average of this quantity\nis represented by thin line like this, this\none, this one, this one, this one, this one.\nNow, talking about shear stress in turbulent\nflow. So, they represent 2 sub figures a and\nb. You see, this represents a particle having\nrandom velocities here and at a point 2 and\nthis represents a velocity profile, a normal\nvelocity profile. And this represents an average\nvelocity profile, as you can see, we have\nplotted the turbulent eddies, here, here,\nsee. So, eddies has been represented.\nSo, the turbulent flow can be often thought\nas a series of random 3 dimensional eddy motion,\nranging from large eddies down to very small\neddies. So, this is large eddie and these\nare small eddies. Vortices, these vortices\nthey transfer momentum so the shear force\nis higher compared with the laminar flow.\nSo, in turbulent flow, the shear force is\nmuch higher than with the, can compared with\nthe laminar flow.\nSo, the total shear stress in a turbulent\nflow can be written as combination of 2 things,\nshear stress due to laminar and plus shear\nstress due to turbulence and this is for the\nlaminar shear stress and this is turbulent\nshear stress. We shall go into more detail,\nwhen we study the modules of viscous fluid\nflow and computational fluid dynamics, about\nrho u dash v dash, they are called Reynold\nshear stress. So, therefore, the shear stress\nin a turbulent motion is much, much larger\nthan the laminar flow.\nSo, here, as I said the shear stress is the\nsum of laminar portion and a turbulent portion.\nAs shown before, tau = Mu du dy – rho u\ndash v dash whole bar. So, tau laminar + tau\nturbulence, where this is fluctuation \nand this shear stress turbulence is positive\nand therefore it is sum of 2 shear stresses.\nShear stress is larger in turbulent flow.\nAlternatively, we can also write, so instead\nof writing, we were writing tau = - rho u\ndash v dash whole bar.\nBut we can also write, tau turbulence as,\ntau turbulence can be written as, another\nviscosity into du dy and this eta is not equal\nto Mu, but much higher and this is called\nturbulent eddy viscosity. This is our approximation,\nwhere eta is eddy viscosity or turbulent eddy\nviscosity.\nSo, there was a scientist called Prandtl.\nHe suggested that the turbulent flow is characterized\nby random transfer over a certain distance\nlm, as we have already talked about this in\nour laminar and turbulent flow module.\nSo, eta can be approximated as, rho lm square\ninto du/dy, where u this is average velocity.\nSee, you have to appreciate that if we are\nable to write something, in terms of average\nvelocity, it makes our life easier. And therefore,\ntau turbulence, if you substitute here, tau\nturbulence can be written as, rho lm square\ninto du/dy whole square, indicating that tau\nturbulence is positive.\nSo, this is figure, showing different areas\nin a pipe flow, which is the layer so the\narea near the wall is called viscous sub layer,\nthen there is something called the turbulent\nlayer, then there is an overlap layer and\nthen there is an outer layer until the centre\nline. So, you see, we have represented tau,\nas a function of r, this is the pipe center\nline and you see, if this is the total shear\nstress, at any point, you can see the contribution.\nSo, near the pipe the contribution of laminar\nflow is laminar is very high. But near the,\nsay for example, at this point, so laminar\nis pretty high, but as soon as you move away\nfrom the wall, the laminar contribution compared\nto the turbulent contribution becomes less\nand less. So, actually we can write that shear\nstress due to turbulence is at least 100 to\n1000 times of shear stress due to laminar.\nSo, laminar contribution is at least 100 to\n1000 times less than the shear stress due\nto turbulence. Now, we said there are several\nlayers in the, we have gone into lot of much\ndetail in our laminar and turbulent. But for\nrepetition, I would like to go once again\nvery briefly, with this and try to solve some\nproblem, as well. So, what is viscous sublayer?\nSo, here, in this viscous sub layer, which\nis very near to the wall, the viscous shear\nstress dominates.\nTherefore, viscosity is dominant and density\nis unimportant, as we have seen before as\nwell. Outer layer, here Reynolds stress is\ndominant and viscosity is unimportant and\ntherefore density is dominant.\nSo, in the viscous sub layer, we can write,\nu bar/u star = yu star/nu. This is called\nthe law of the wall, where y = R - small r,\nu is time average x component and u star is\nshear stress/rho to the power half also called\nas friction velocity. So, there is a curve\nfigure, here and using this figure, this is\nu bar by centerline velocity and r/R is given\nthe different, for different, you know, this\nlaminar flow curve is given here and there\nis n = 8, n= 6.\nWhat that n is, we will come. So, very valid,\nI mean, this viscous sublayer is valid very\nnear the smooth wall. So, this is valid. So,\nthis viscous, this law of the wall is valid,\nwhich is very near to the wall. The value\nof which is given by yu star/nu <5. So, the\nthickness of the laminar sublayer can be written\nas, 5 nu/u star. This is important to remember.\nI think you must remember this value.\nIn the overlap layer, you see the overlap\nlayer. You remember this overlap layer? This\nlayer, this log law is valid by u bar/u star\nis equals to 2.5 ln yu star/nu + 5.0. I think\nwe have gone through it in our other lecture.\nHere, the coefficients of 2.5 and 5.0 have\nbeen obtained experimentally.\nIn the turbulent layer, we can also write\nit in form of centerline velocity, the graph\nof which was given here. Vc - u bar, this\nis called velocity defect law in outer layer\nis given as, 2.5 ln R/y or u bar/Vc is equal\nto, this was the equation, for which the curve\nwas given. What is going to be the value of\nn, can be determined from this graph, with\nthe corresponding values of, you know, u/Vc\nand r/R.\nSo, and this equation is called power law\nvelocity profile and this n is a function\nof Reynolds number. So, velocity defect or\nretardation of flow due to wall effects, so\nthis is the curve, where using which n can\nbe determined. And if you determine n, from\nthis graph then for corresponding n, you can\nuse this table for finding, sorry, this graph\nfor finding the relationship between u/Vc\nand r/R.\nSo, in our question, probably we will be using\nthis thing, this particular concept. So, you,\nI mean, this is again a repetition, because\nwe have gone through with this in the turbulent\nlayer. But the problem that we are going to\nsolve is completely new and will give you\nmuch more idea how to solve for this in the\npipe flow.\nSo, the class question is that, water at 20\ndegree centigrade, the nu and rho is given,\nflows through a horizontal pipe of 0.1 meter\ndiameter with a flow rate of 4 into 10 to\nthe power -2 meter cube per second and a pressure\ngradient of 2.59 kilopascals per meter. If\nwe assume 1 meter pipe length, determine the\napproximate thickness of viscous sub layer,\nformula we know, determine the approximate\ncenterline velocity Vc and determine the ratio\nof turbulent to laminar shear stress, at a\npoint midway between the centerline and the\npipe wall.\nSee, if we the thickness of viscous sub layer,\nwe will also find the centerline velocity\nand for finding centerline velocity, you see,\nwe had this curves here. We can find n here\nfirst and then using n we can find the centerline\nvelocity. And the best part is that we will\nbe able to appreciate by finding out the ratio\nof the turbulent to laminar shear stress,\nat some point. So, we will solve this question\nin this lecture.\nAnd we will finish this particular lecture\nafter the solution. So, thickness of viscous\nsublayer is going to be delta s u star/nu\n= 5, so delta s 5 nu/u star. So, we do not\nknow u star, but u star can be written as\ntau w/rho to the power half. And how do we\nobtain the wall shear stress tau w? So, tau\nw can be obtained from pressure drop formula\nof delta p is equal to, you remember, 4l tau\nw/D that we derived.\nIt is valid because it is valid for both laminar\nand turbulent flow. So, tau w would be D delta\np/4l and after substituting the value, we\nare going to get 64.75 or 64.8 Newton per\nmeter square. Therefore, we can get u star\nas 0.255 meters per second and therefore,\nwe can get thickness of viscous sublayer as\n5 into, nu was 1.004, into 10 to the power\n-6/0.255 and that gives us 1.97 into 10 to\nthe power -5 meter or delta s is 0.02 millimeters.\nSo, you see how thin this viscous sub layer\nis. Now, second, we have to obtain the centerline\nvelocity. So, we know that the centerline\nvelocity can be obtained from the average\nvelocity, using that power law velocity profile.\nSo, first of all we find average velocity\nas V = Q/A, Q was 0.04 pi/4 into 0.1 square.\nSo, velocity we are getting 5.09 meters per\nsecond.\nCorresponding Reynolds number will be VD/nu.Values\nwe already know, V is 5.09, diameter is 0.1\nand it is 1.004 into 10 to the power -6. So,\nit comes to be 5.07 into 10 to the power 5.\nSo, with this Reynold number, using Reynold\nnumber of this 5 into 10 to the power 5, corresponds\nto the value of n = 8.4 from the curve. This\nis important to note it down. So, we look\nat Reynold number and we look at the curve.\nSo, we can use this formula, u bar/Vc = 1\n– r/R, the centerline velocity formula,\ndivided by1.84 and we also know that Q = A\ninto V or integral udA. So, we use u bar from\nhere. So, Vc will come out and r = 0 to r\n= R 1-r/R to the power 1 – r and integral\n2 pi rdr, we integrate, and after integration\nwe will see, we will get 2piR square Vc into\nn square/n + 1 into 2n + 1. Now, we substitute,\nn = 8.4 and this Q is also equal to 2 pi R\nsquare. Sorry, Q is not 2 pi R square.\nThis will be pi R square into the velocity\nthat we had obtained last time. That was 5.09\nthe average velocity. Because this is also\nequal to Q. So, now, if we equate both of\nthose, what we are going to get? V/Vc = 2n\nsquare/n + 1 into 2n + 1 and we substitute\nthe value here. Therefore, Vc will be 1.186\nV and V already we know 5.09. So, Vc is going\nto be 6.04 meters per second. So, that is\npart b.\nIf, you remember, for laminar flow this Vc\nwas 2 times the average velocity. But in turbulent\nflow Vc is not 2 times because V was 5.09\nand Vc is not even 1.2 times also Vc. So,\nbut the centerline velocity is lesser than\nwhat it should be in the laminar flow.\nNow, the c part, we know, we are calculating\nshear stress, it is 2 tau w r/D. So, tau is\n2 into, tau w we have already calculated as\n64.8, r is, we have been given. We have to\nfind this distance r, at what distance small\nr is given. So, this is coming out to be tau\nis 32.4 Newton per meter square. And this\nis sum of both laminar plus turbulent. We\nalso know that tau laminar is given as, minus\nMu du bar dr, from the velocity profile law.\nAnd then, from the velocity profile law, if\nwe try to find out du bar du/dr, it is going\nto be -Vc/nR into 1 – r/R, in velocity profile,\nwe can write. So, we will calculate du dr,\nso minus it is, we already calculated and\nn was, we already found out from the curve,\n0.05 into 1-0.025 already given, radius was\n0.05 into 1 - 8.4/8.4. So, du/dr is coming\nto be -26.5 per second. Therefore, tau laminar\nwill be -Mu du dr and that comes out to be\n-Mu is 1.004 into 10 to the power -6 into\n26.5.\nSo, tau laminar is coming out to be 0.0266\nNewton per meter square. So, ratio of tau\nturb to tau laminar will be tau - tau laminar/tau\nlaminar. So, 32.4 - 0.0266/0.0266 and this\nratio comes out to be 1217 almost. So, you\nsee, the ratio of the turbulent shear stress\nto laminar shear stress is of the order of\nthousands, as they have claimed before.\nSo, I think, this is a fine place to, you\nknow, stop this lecture and we will continue\nwith our further topics in our next class.\nThank you so much for listening.",
    "video_31": "Welcome back. So, last time, we solved a question,\nusing the laminar and the turbulent shear\nstresses. We calculated the laminar viscous\nsublayer thickness, then we calculated the\ncenterline velocity, using those equations\nof turbulent velocity profile and then in\nthe end, we calculated the ratio of turbulent\nshear stress to laminar shear stress and found\nout that the ratio is more than 1000, it was\nalmost 1217. Indicating that, in a turbulent\nflow, the ratio of turbulent shear stress\nto laminar shear stress is very, very high.\nSo, in turbulent flow, the dominating shear\nstress is due to the turbulence. Now, we are\ngoing to start a topic, dimensional analysis\nof pipe flow. So, pipes are generally considered\nrough and they have roughness, that is, so\nthey have this roughness and because of this\nroughness, there is loss of energy due to\nviscous flow in the straight element and this\nloss that happens due to the viscous flow\nis called the major loss in pipes.\nSo, there are two types of losses in pipe,\nwhich is, one is major loss and the other\nis minor losses. The minor losses happen due\nto the pipe components. Suppose, for example,\nthere are junctions at pipes or there is a\nbend or there is a contraction or an expansion,\nthen also there will be some loss in the energy\ncontained in the turbulent flow and those\nlosses are called minor losses.\nSo, for major losses during the dimensional\nanalysis, we say that the pressure drop should\nbe a function of the velocity in the pipe\ndiameter D, length L of the pipe, mu the viscosity\nand the density of the liquid. Here, we have\nan additional element that is roughness height,\nepsilon. This is a new thing that we are going\nto take into account. Earlier, we said that\nthe pipes were smooth, there were no roughness\nelements. So, pipe, there are roughness elements,\nlike this.\nIn principle, there are roughness elements,\nlike this. So, if we do the dimensional analysis,\nthen we first write down K. How many? 1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6 and then 7 and r is 3. So, how\nmany dimensionless term? K – r, that we\nare going to get 4 dimensionless term. If,\nyou do the Buckingham pi theorem analysis,\nwe are going to get, so this is, as I said,\nwas the roughness element, epsilon. This is\nthe roughness element, as I showed you before\nas well.\nWe will get one dimensionless term, second\ndimensionless, third and fourth. As we said\nK – r, 7 – 3 = 4 dimensionless term and\nI ask you to do it as a homework question.\nIf you have any problems, you can ask us about\nthat in the forum. So, this is the general\nequation for pressure drop for a pipe flow\nwith roughness element of epsilon E.\nSo, again we write down, delta P by 1/2 rho\nv square is a function of rho VD by mu l by\nD and epsilon by D. This is what? This is\nReynolds number. This we know from before,\nrho VD by mu. Now, we already know from before,\nthe pressure drop is proportional to the length\nof the tube. So, we can take l by D outside\nand we can write, delta P by 1/2 rho V square\nis equal to l by D, as a function of Reynolds\nnumber and epsilon by D.\nHow this depends, we still do not know. Until\nnow, I mean, under the topics that we have\ncovered, we still do not know, but other things\nwe know, 1/2 Rho V square l by D, Reynolds\nnumber also we know. We do not know how to\nfind epsilon and we also do not know how this\nfunction is dependent upon Reynolds number\nand epsilon by D. But that we will get to\nknow in the upcoming slides.\nSo, again we write down the same equation,\ndelta p by 1/2 rho V square is l by d and\na function of Reynolds number and epsilon\nby D. So, we bring l by D, on the other side\nand define. So, if you take D on this side\nand l here and term is at f. So, f is nothing\nbut delta p into D divided by 1/2 l rho V\nsquare and this we call friction factor f.\nSo, f is a function of Reynolds number and\nepsilon by D.\nSo, as I wrote, f is equal to a function of\nReynolds number and epsilon by D. And if we\nare able to find this f, we can easily calculate\ndelta p as f into, because see, if you use\nthis equation again, we can write, delta p\nis equal to f into l by D into rho V square\nby 2. So, if we are able to calculate this\nf; we know l, we know D, we know rho, we know\nV, so everything will be calculated. So, the\nchallenge is now, finding f \nand this is valid for horizontal pipes, this\nequation.\nNow, for a fully developed laminar flow, we\nalready found out that, what that f was, it\nwas 64 by Re. From our previous lectures in\npipe flow, we have derived that f is equal\nto 64 by Re for fully developed laminar flow.\nBut for fully developed steady incompressible\nflow, we also know that the head loss is going\nto be, if we assume, delta p is the head loss\nand that will be transformed into energy loss,\nequivalent to rho gh. So, hL major can be\nwritten as, delta p by rho g.\nJust concentrate on this. So, this is the\nhead loss major and delta p by rho g can be,\nso if you use this equation and divide it\nby rho g, so what are you going to get, f\nwill remain same f, l by D will remain same,\nrho and rho gets cancelled and we can get\nf into l by D into V square by 2g. So, the\nmajor head loss is going to be f l by D into\nV square by 2g. So, the major head loss, l\nwe know, D we know, V we know and g is a constant.\nSo, again the problem is, we still do not\nknow f, but for f we know, it is a function\nof Reynolds number and epsilon by D and this\nparticular equation is called the Darcy-Weisbach\nequation, a very, very important \nequation for the major head losses in the\npipe. So, how do we estimate f? For f, if\nwe would know Reynolds number and epsilon\nby D, everything would be, the recipe would\nbe available to find out the friction factor\nf.\nSo, this before going to how to find out this\nepsilon by D, I have a small class problem,\nwhich we are going to solve. So, the question\nsays that water flows through a pipe line\nwhose diameter varies from 20 centimeters\nto 10 centimeter in a length of 10 meters.\nIf the Darcy-Weisbach equation factor is assumed\nto be constant, so f is given constant at\n0.02 for the whole pipe. Determine the head\nloss in friction, when the pipe is flowing\nfull with a discharge of 50 liters per second.\nSo, we are going to solve this question.\nSo, we say, consider a stretch of length dx\nat a distance x from 20 meter diameter end.\nThis was 20 meter, sorry, 20 centimeter diameter\nend and this was 10 centimeter. So, we assume,\nat a distance x, strip of thickness dx here.\nSo, dh fx will be f l, so l is here dx by,\nso V square by 2gd. If we write in terms of\nQ, we can write f, friction factor f Q square\ndx divided by 2g pi by 4 whole square into\nD to the power 5 because Q square, V square\nwill be Q square by a square and a is d to\nthe power 4. So, we are going to get this\nequation.\nHere, this is the diameter D, at distance\nx. So, we need to find what that D is and\nD can be written as, see, it is varying from\n20, 20 centimeter. So, we can write to convert\nit to meter, one by 100 and this will come\n20 - x in meters. This is the diameter. So,\nwe proceed forward.\nSo, dh fx will be 0.008263 f into Q square\ninto 10 to the power 10 dx divided by 20 - x\nto the power 5. This will be, if you calculate,\nit will be 41313 into dx by 20 - x to the\npower 5. So, total head loss will be integral\nof dh fx from 10 centimeter to, so I mean,\nfrom 0 to 10. So, total head loss is going\nto be 41313 integral 0 to 10, 20 - x to the\npower -5 dx and total head loss hf is going\nto be 0.968 meter. So, this is how you solve\nthis question, a very simple application,\nbecause the Darcy-Weisbach equation friction\nwas already given.\nSo, this is one question. So, until now, what\nwe have done? We have obtained the pressure\ndrop and as a function of another quantity,\npressure drop was as a function of Darcy's\nfriction f, where f is some function of Reynolds\nnumber and epsilon by D. In laminar flow,\nfully developed laminar flow, it was only\na function of Reynolds number, as 64 by Re.\nBut before going in detail into that, we just\nsolved, if we are given that friction factor\nf, Darcy's friction factor f, how are we able\nto apply these formulas of dh fx to find the\nhead loss.\nNow, there is another question. It says that\nin a horizontal pipe of diameter D, which\nis carrying a steady flow, there will be a\npressure drop in a length L of the pipe. It\nsays, prove that if bed shear stress is tau\nnot is equal to rho u star square, then u\nstar can be written as nu into under root\nf by 8, where f is Darcy Weisbach friction.\nAnd then a question is given that water flows\nin a 2 centimeter diameter pipe. Now, taking\nthe kinematic viscosity of water as 0.0098\nstoke, calculate the largest discharge for\nwhich the flow can be definitely laminar.\nSo, largest discharge will be at largest velocity,\nthat means, we will have to utilize some Reynolds\nnumber, you know. And then in the end, it\nsays, what is the boundary shear stress for\nthis discharge. So, we will go one by one\nfor the solution.\nSo, the first part is pretty simple. You have\nto equate \nthe frictional resistance with the \ndifference in pressure forces. So, instead\nof delta p, we write, P2 - P1 into pi D to\nthe power 2 by 4 is equal to tau not into\npi DL. So, tau not, using this can be written\nas P2 - P1 into D by 4L or minus delta P D\nby 4L, because P is P1 - P2. Now, designation\ntau not is f by 4 rho V square by 2. Here,\nf is Darcy-Weisbach friction.\nSo, under root tau not by rho is equal to\nmu star is equal to V under root f by 8. This\nis how we get from this equation. Now, starting\nwith the second part, part B.\nThe \nlargest discharge corresponds to the critical\nReynolds number, which is for the largest\nit can be for laminar, it can be maximum 2000.\nRemember? Reynold critical will be 2000 is\nequal to VD by nu, which will give us velocity\nas 2000 into nu is 0.0098 into 10 to the power\n-4 divided by the diameter, 0.02 gives us\n0.098 meters per second. Therefore, Q will\nbe pi by 4 into diameter whole square into\nthis velocity. This is going to be 0.03079\nliters per second.\nInstead of meters, we have multiplied 10 to\nthe power 3 and made it in liters per second\nor if in terms of minutes, you can simply\nsay, multiply it by 60 and say 1.847 liters\nper minute. So, this is the largest discharge,\nalso f can be written as 64 by Re, which is\ncomes 0.032. So, u star can be calculated\nat under root f by 8, f is 0.098, we have\nalready found out. f was 0.032 divided by\n8 eight or 6.198 into 10 to the power -3.\nSimilarly, tau not will be rho u star square,\nwhich we have calculated and it will come\nout to be 0.0383 Pascal. So, this is yet another\nsimple question of the Darcy-Weisbach equation,\nvery simple. So, we go back.\nAnd there is one more problem. So, this is\nthe last problem before the end of today's\nlecture that we are going to do. And it says\nis, design the diameter of a steel pipe to\ncarry water with mean velocity of 1 meters\nper second. The head loss is to be limited\nto 10 centimeter per 100 meter length. The\neffective roughness height can be taken as\n0.45. Now, use the following empirical formula\nfor friction factor.\nSo, in this question, you see, we already\nhave been given Es, this thing. So, f we can\ncalculate. We have been given the functional\ndependence of f, how to find out f. So, it\nis a pretty simple problem, if we are given\nf. We just you need to follow the basic steps.\nHow do we solve this problem?\nFirst, we find the Reynolds number. So, VD\nby mu and V 1 meters per second, diameter\nD, let it be this and mu is 1 into 10 to the\npower -6, so it becomes 10 to the power 6D\nin terms of diameter. We have already been\ngiven Es, that is, 0.45 into 10 to the power\n-3. Now, if we substitute, this in this value,\nthe f which we have given, because most of\nthe things we know already, into 0.45 into\n10 to the power 3 by D. Because D is we do\nnot know, that is what we have to find out,\ninto D.\nSo, f can be written as, in final, it can\nbe 0.0055 + 6.812 into 10 to the power -3\ndivided by D to the power 1 by 3. And hf will\nbe fL V square by 2gD. So, head loss has already\nbeen given, it says 10 in 100, that is, what\nit said. If it says the head loss is limited\nto 10 centimeter + 100 meters of length. So,\nhead loss has been given. So, we can write,\n10 by 100 is equal to f by D into 100 into\n1 divided by 2.981.\nThis will give us f is equal to, in terms\nof this is 0.01962 D. So, we have two equations\nfor D, sorry, two equations of f. So, the\nvalue of D is obtained by trial and error,\nfrom above equations of f and f is found out\nto \nbe 0.0133 and corresponding D comes out to\nbe 0.678 meters. So, if there is a practical\nproblem in practice, we would use next larger\nstandard size, because the pipe diameters\ndoes not come, it is very difficult to design\n0.678 meter.\nMaybe 0.7 meters is available, so we are not\ngoing to use 0.678, but the next higher size\navailable. So, this concludes our this particular\nquestion. I am moving ahead.\nSo, before we close this class, I would like\nto take this. What is the equivalent roughness\nfor the pipes? Epsilon. Sorry. What is epsilon?\nSo, epsilon is a material property and this\nepsilon can be obtained for practical senses,\nwith tables like this. Here, it is given that\nfor riveted steel epsilon is of varies from\n0.9 to 9.0. Concrete it is going to be 0.3\nand 3.0. And wood stave, for example, 0.18\nto 0.9. So, for every type of pipe, a corresponding\nepsilon will be told to us from before.\nFor your purpose, most likely the epsilon\nwill be given in the question because otherwise,\nyou will have to, I mean, otherwise you will\nhave to look it from the table, if we do not\ngive you epsilon, will give you the table.\nSo, you look which type of pipe is there among\nthese for example, and you find out epsilon\nand then proceed with your problem. So, now\nyou remember f, the Darcy friction was a function\nof Reynolds number, epsilon by D.\nReynolds number we know how to calculate,\nepsilon would be given and D would also be\ngiven. So, we know everything, but how it\nis dependent we do not know. This part we\nstill do not know.\nSo, to answer that we have to proceed further,\nbut before that there is a class problem.\nThis is one question that we would like to\ndo again. But I would like to close this lecture\nnow and start our new lecture by solving this\nparticular problem. Thank you so much for\nlistening and I will see you in the next week.",
    "video_32": "Welcome back students. Last lecture we were\ntalking about the minor losses due to the\ncontraction.\nAnd this week and in this lecture we are going\nto start the losses due to enlargement. So\nwhat is sudden enlargement? A sudden enlargement\nin a pipe is something like this you see if\nthere is a pipe which is going in a reservoir\nfor example reservoir or any structure that\nis bigger than this pipe. So going from one\nsmaller pipe into a large pipe for example\nso this is enlargement okay.\nSo in that case what happens the head loss\ncan be simply given as V1 – V2 whole square/2g\nokay in a sudden enlargement it will be given\nas V1 – V2 whole square/2g.\nSo if there is point 1 here, 2 here and 3\nhere the head loss can also be referred as\nKL into V1 square/2g where V1 is the velocity\nin the narrower tube and what that KL is going\nto be this KL will be again a ratio of A1/A2\nwhere A1 is the smaller okay. Suppose the\nsecond area is very large all right. You see\nhere so suppose this is very large so A1/A2\nis tending to 0 and therefore the entire energy\nwill be lost.\nThis is just a matter of interpretation from\nthe curve. So best is to find the ratio of\nthe areas of A1 and A2 and take the KL from\nhere put it here and multiply it by V1 square/2g.\nYou saw in the contraction it was V2 square/2g\nand in case of expansion it is V1 square/2g.\nSo those velocities needs to be considered\nwhere the smaller pipes are there. So the\nsmaller pipes in case of contraction was at\n2 so we had K into V2 square/2g.\nHere in case of enlargement this smaller pipe\nis at 1 so it is KL into VL square/2g okay.\nA KL will have a general formula as 1 – A1/A2\nwhole square you can also use this equation\nfor KL. Okay you put A1/A2 = 0 that means\nKL will be 1 so whole energy is going to be\nlost. I think it is better to remember in\ncase of sudden enlargement the KL = 1 – A1/A2\nwhole square remember this one it is easier\nand of course this one okay.\nAnd in case of sudden contraction KL was 0.5\nif you remember. So if you put this we come\nback to the formula which we saw in the last\npage. You can also see head loss is going\nto be V1 – V2 whole square2g as we saw in\nthe last slide here okay. This is also important.\nNow you note that the drop in energy line\nis much larger than in case of the contraction\nof course you will see that because see in\nmost of the cases in case of sudden contraction\nthe KL was 0.5 wherein case of sudden expansion\nKL was (()) (04:37) so whole energy is going\nto be lost. So in case of sudden expansion\nthe drop in the energy line would be very\nrapid all right and this is abrupt expansion\nthis is gradual expansion this is abrupt.\nSo see the sudden fall in the line this is\ngradual this is abrupt all right. So smaller\nhead loss than in the case of an abrupt expansion\nis for the gradual expansion like we had the\ngradual contraction we have something called\ngradual expansion.\nSo head losses due to pipe enlargement maybe\ngreatly reduced by introducing gradual pipe\ntransition known as diffusers that was (()) (05:36)\nand this was diffuser something like this.\nIn this case also we will have a formula for\nthe head loss as KE dash into V1 square – V2\nsquare/2g okay and KE can be taken from this\ntable. When you will be provided with those\nvalues if at all some questions comes for\nthe gradual pipe transition or gradual contraction\nor gradual expansion, but you have to remember\nfor the scenarios like this okay.\nSo now head loss due to gradual enlargement\nagain the same thing as we had in contraction\nconical diffusers in this also it will be\nhL is given as KL into V1 square – V2 square/2g\nwhere you can there are many, many experiments\nthat have been done and you will find a different\nvalue of KL based on different alpha and more\nor less every value would be more or less\nsimilar okay.\nNow loss due to pipe entrance. So general\nformula for head loss at the entrance of the\npipe is also expressed in terms of velocity\nhead. So if there is an entrance pipe entrance\nokay so the loss will be V square/2g into\nK entrance. So for different configuration\nthis is the most common one that you will\nencounter. So you just need to remember this\none pipe entrance if nothing is given you\nhave to take the K entrance as 0.5 all right.\nIn this case where the pipes are protruding\ninwards Ke is going to be 1.0 so all the energy\nis going to loss. If there is a smooth curve\nlike this you saw in the third one here it\nis going to be 0.04, but this is most important.\nSo K entrance you have to remember if nothing\nelse is given is 0.5 and V square of course\nV should be calculated here because this is\na reservoir. In reservoir there would be very\nlittle velocity okay velocities should be\nhere.\nNow the head loss at the entrance of the pipe\nthat is when the flow is leaving a tank in\nthis case it is the same thing all right.\nSo sharp edge this is also entrance only this\nis the one that we studied in the last slide.\nIf it is well rounded you saw that there was\na value of 0.04 it is a much more you know\ngood looking figure but the message is the\nsame. If it is well rounded KL is 0.04.\nIf t is slightly rounded it is 0.2 if it is\nembedded inside you saw we had one figure\nwhere everything was inside therefore there\nKL was = 1, but in this case it is 0.8. So\nthis is nothing, but pipe entrance by default\njust take 0.5 if nothing else has been given.\nNow different pipe inlets again the same thing\nyou see K inlet, K entrance. So these many\nequations you cannot remember I mean these\nmany values. So only the most common one which\nthe one which I have been telling try to remember\nthose. So increasing loss coefficient has\nbeen demonstrated here like this.\nAnother typical values for various amounts\nof rounding of the lip you see these are based\non all the different experiments that people\nhave done.\nSo these curves will be now we have talked\nabout entrance, we have talked about contraction,\nwe have talked about expansion. Now we have\ntalked about entrance to the pipe. Now what\nis the head loss at the exit of the pipe something\nlike this when the pipe is terminating in\na reservoir okay when the pipe is terminating\nin the reservoir what is going to happen whole\nvelocity because reservoir is so big everything\nis going to be lost right.\nSo if K exit is always going to be one remember\nthat. You see whatever this thing is KL is\nalways going to be 1.0 very easy to remember\nand head loss is simply V square/2g where\nV is calculated at these points okay do not\ntry to calculate V here because it will come\nto be 0 in the reservoir. The kinetic energy\nof the exiting fluid that is velocity V1 is\ndissipated through viscous effects as stream\nof the fluid mixes with the fluid in the tank\nand eventually comes to rest this is what\nexactly I have told you.\nNow the head loss due to bends in the pipes\nso many formulas are there we say kb into\nV square/2g okay velocity will remain the\nsame even the bend is there so we need to\nneed kb for different values of R/D D is the\ndiameter of the pipe and R is the radius of\nthe curvature of the pipe. There are different\nvalues of Kb either you will be given these\ntables or given the values.\nMiter bends.\nSo due to the head losses due to the pipe\nfitting you see different type you will be\nprovided with these values okay everything\nwill be K all the minor losses of the form\nK into V square/2g okay.\nSo it is a closed valve there is open valve\nsee there are losses of the order of 10.0\nif the valve is fully rotary value it is fully\nopen.\nSo the loss coefficients has been summarized\nhere for elbows, bends and you know tees.\nYou see 0.3, 1.5, 0.2, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5, 0.2,\n0.9, 1.0, 2.0.\nSo this is a table again for pipe components.\nSo for the examination and assignment purpose\nassignment purpose you can look back I mean\nyou can keep the tables with yourself, but\nin exams these values will mostly be provided\nonly those values which are very common like\nthe K entrance, K exit, sudden contraction,\nsudden expansion and things like that, that\nwould not be provided.\nThose values will not be provided and you\nare expected to know this the formulas okay.\nSo important message is that minor losses\nis K into V square/2g and the K can be obtained\nfrom tables or charts okay.\nSo this is a table of minor loss coefficient\nI said this is a summary do not have to worry\nabout it. This is when you go and start working\nin a company where this pipe losses are in\nrelevant than you can make the use of this\ntype of charts and tables for quick reference\nall right.\nSo minor loss calculation using equivalent\npipe length. So equivalent pipe length can\nbe kl into D/f where Le is the equivalent\npipeline that we are going to calculate D\nis the diameter of the pipe k1 is the loss\ncoefficient for any fitting valve and f is\nthe Darcy Weisbach coefficient. For example\nthere are several pipes connected in either\nseries or parallel or combination of those.\nAnd somebody ask you to calculate the equivalent\npipe length if there was one single pipe with\nequivalent pipe you know with equivalent pipe\ndiameter what would be the effective pipe\nlength so you can use this formula.\nNow let us solve a question so that gives\nus more confidence these questions is about\nmajor and minor losses mainly and it stands\nat a pipeline of 60 centimeter in diameter\ntakes off from the reservoir whose water surface\nelevation is 150 meter above the datum okay.\nThe pipe is 5,000 meter long and is laid completely\nat the datum level. In the last 1,200 meter\nof the pipe water is withdrawn by a series\nof pipes at uniform rate of 0.088 per 300\nmeter.\nFind the pressure at the end of the pipeline\nassume f = 0.02 and the pipe have a dead end\nokay. So if you understand this question.\nSo I am going to solve this \nso first an expression for the head loss in\npipe having a uniform withdrawal of q* meter\ncube per second per meter length is derived\nbecause it says the water is withdrawn by\na series of pipes with a uniform rate all\nright. So to be able to do that we consider\na section at a distance \nx from the start of the uniform withdrawal\nokay. So this is a pipe so diameter is D and\nwe have Q0 and from here we assume a distance\nx okay.\nAnd this distance is L0 all right and the\nwithdrawal is \nuniform that is q*. So discharge is going\nat x will be Q0 – q* into x right. So in\na small distance dx so at x we assume small\ndistance dx here. The head loss is going to\nbe flv square/2g D right or instead of v we\nwrite Q correct so we can write f Q0 – q*\nx whole square 2g into pi/4 whole square into\nD to the power 5 all right.\nSo after so I will take this here now so I\nam just writing dhf will be just writing 8f/pi\nsquare g D to the power 5 into Q – q*x whole\nsquare dx all right. So hf is going to be\nintegral of dhf and from there 0 to L0 this\nis going to be from 0 to L0 okay.\nSo now we calculate so hf comes to be 8f/3\npi square g D to the power into 1/q * Q0 cube\n– Q0 – q* L0 whole cube all right. So\nthis is the general head loss for the continuous\nwithdrawal that we have found out. So in present\nproblem Q0 is 1,200/300 into 0.088 all right.\nSo we have 0.352 meter cube per second and\nthis q* is 0.088/300 that is 2.933 into 10\nto the power -4 meter cube per second per\nmeter and L0 has been given as 1,200 meter\nall right.\nSo apart from that if we say HL = total head\nlost okay. What is the total head lost so\nhead lost in first 5,000 meter with discharge\nQ0 = 0.352 meter cube per second + head lost\nin last 1,200 with uniform withdrawal. So\ntotal head loss is going to be the head lost\nin first 3,800 meter with discharge Q0 that\nis going to be the major head loss right and\nthe second one was we use differential equation\nand that is what we wrote hf2 okay here hf.\nSo total HL will be hf1 + hf2 and what is\nhf1 it is the major loss right and that is\ngoing to be 0.02 that is already given into\nthe length was 3,800 into 0.352 whole square\nbecause that is the velocity 2 into 9.81 into\npi/4 whole square into 0.6 to the power 5\nand this comes on calculation as 10 meter.\nWhat is the hf2 is the last 12,00 meters where\nwe have derived that equation which was 8f.\nThis was what we derived 3 pi square g D to\nthe power 5 into 1/q* into Q0 cube – Q0\n– q* L0 whole cube and if you solve this\nwith the appropriate values of f is 0.02 and\nother things you will get hf2 as 1.053 meter.\nNow the question is what is the residual head\nat the dead end. So this is going to be residual\nhead at the other end all right. 134.947 meter\nokay. So these are lengthy questions.\nBut the idea of covering this is that you\nare able to solve any type of problem after\nlearning this course, of course the assignment\nwill have simpler problem because it will\nbe mostly objective type or fill in the blanks.\nSo there will be small, small problems rather\nthan such big and complicated problems, but\nthis is a nice practice and we will expose\nyou to all type of problems that you can encounter\nin pipe flow.\nNow something about energy and hydraulic and\nenergy grade line you see. So unless the local\neffect are of particular interest the changes\nin EGL and HGL are often shown as abrupt changes\neven though the loss occurs over some distance\nyou see okay.\nSo in the figure shown below two new cast\niron pipes are in series, length of each pipe\nis given and level at A is also given all\nright. Now we have to find the water level\nat B a very simple and good question okay.\nSo see whatever be the difference between\nthe levels at A and – B this ZA – ZB should\nbe = hf that is the head loss between point\nA and point B all right okay and now this\nhf should be the sum of energy loss I mean\nthe losses.\nNow can you think where this losses will occur\nthere will be loss at the entrance here right,\nthere will be a loss here okay due to contraction\nand there will be a loss due to exit apart\nfrom that these are the three minor losses.\nThere will be one loss major loss M1 here\nand there will be loss M2 here due to the\nflow in the sections of the pipe long sections\nof the pipe all right good.\nSo to solve that we will take the help of\nwhite screen again so solution number 10 ZA\n– ZB = hf and this total hf or hL will be\nhf1 + hf2 + h entrance + hc + h exit. The\nthree minor losses and there are two major\nlosses. F1 means major loss in pipe 1 major\nloss in pipe 2 okay. So we can simply write\nthe formula first f1 L1/D1 into V1 square/2g\n+ f2 L2/D2 into V2 square/2g + K entrance\nV1 square/2g + Kc into V2 square/2g + K exit\ninto V2 square/2g.\nThis is an important formula that now we need\nto find out the flow properties in pipe 1\nand 2. So simply pipe 1 they will be discharged\nby area 1, discharge is given 0.5 and this\nis the length and diameter everything is given.\nSo it will come 1.77 meters per second whereas\nV2 will come out to be Q/A2 0.5 diameters\nare different so pi/4 into 0.4 whole square\nand this will come to be 3.98 meters per second\nall right.\nSo if we know (()) (29:59) we know Re1 V1\nD1/nu and you put the value of velocity D\nand mu you will get 8.1 into 10 to the power\n5. Similarly here Re2 will come out to be\nV2 D2, but you would be wondering why we need\nto calculate with Reynolds numbers and those\nparameters. The reason is we want to calculate\nthe major head loss and major head loss will\ndepend upon f.\nF is the friction factor which will depend\nupon Reynolds number and epsilon/D all right.\nSo this come out to be 1.22 into 10 to the\npower 6 okay. So we have calculated Re1, we\nhave calculated Re2 here epsilon/D1 will be\n0.26/600 and here epsilon/D2 is going to be\nso this comes out to be actually 0.00043 and\nthis one comes out to be 0.00065. So we know\nRe1 here we know epsilon/D1 here we know Re2\nhere we know epsilon/D2.\nSo we can actually use the Haaland equation\nor the Moody Chart and find out f1if you look\nat the Moody Chart or find the Haaland or\nuse the Haaland equation it will come 0.017\nand this f2 is going to come to be 0.018 all\nright. So now it is just the matter of putting\neverything together. I am going to use this\nslot so hf so we know everything 0.017 into\n300/0.6 into 1.77 square/2g + 0.018 into length\nis 300 only/0.4 into V2 square is 3.98 whole\nsquare/2g.\nThese two are major losses plus minor losses.\nThe entrance was the 0.5 into 1.77 square/2g\nand this 0.27 is given to us or we can look\nup at the table 3.98 whole square/2g. The\nlast one is exit so whole energy is going\nto be lost so 3.98 whole square/2g. So if\nyou calculate in the end the total loss is\ngoing to be 13.36 meter. So let me rub something\nhere okay. So the final solution the head\nloss is going to be 13.36 meter.\nAnd therefore ZA – ZB is going to be 80\n– 13.36 all right. I think we should not\nmake it so much cluttered, but now you understand\nthe process. We calculated the major losses,\nwe calculated the minor losses and we calculated\nthe total thing and here we get the level\nat ZA as 80 – 13.36 as 66.64 meter okay\nthis was the elevation. Good so I think with\nthis I will end today’s lecture and continue\nin another lecture when we meet next. Thank\nyou so much for listening have a good day.",
    "video_33": "Welcome back.\nLast class we solved this particular problem\nwhich is shown in the slide and we are going\nto continue in this lecture.\nI am going to solve yet another question.\nThe question here is, for the pumping set-up\nshown in figure below, this figure, estimate\nthe power required and the pressure at the\nsuction side of the pump.\nWe see that the atmospheric head here is 10\nmeters and we have to assume both the major\nand the minor losses.\nYou see there are two pipes and these things\nare given AP the diameter of the pipe is given,\nthe length is given, the friction factor for\neach of these pipes is given.\nSo how do we solve this?\nWe have to estimate the power required by\nthis pump \nand pressured required at this suction side\nof the pump.\nSo we will continue with 11.\nSo static head is 110 – 95 you see, that\nis the static head.\nIf you remember the figure and that is 15\nmeter, velocity in the pipe 1 would be Q/A1,\nthe pipe 1 was before the pump, the pipe 2\nwas after the pump.\nTherefore, V1Q is given as 20 liters per second,\nso it is 0.02 and area is pi/4 and the diameter\nis also given 0.15, so it will come out to\nbe 1.132 meters per second.\nSimilarly, for the delivery pipe, that is,\nvelocity in the delivery pipe, this is a suction\npipe \nand V2 is the delivery pipe, we can, A 1 V1\n= A2 V2 and therefore V1 can be written as\nD1 square/D2 square and therefore 1 point\nor you can do also Q/A2, 15/12, D2 was 12\nand therefore it will come to be 1.769 meters\nper second in the delivery pipe.\nSo the major loss in pipe 1 will be f1 L1/D1\ninto V1 square/2g, f1 is also given in pipe\n1.\nLength is 20 meters it is given, diameter\nwe already know 0.15 meter into V1 we found\nout, 1.132 whole square/2 into 9.81 and this\ncomes to be 0.174 meter.\nSo there will also be a inlet loss and that\nis 0.5 into, this is the minor loss, V1 square/2g,\nso 0.5 into 1.132 whole square/2 into 9.81,\nso 0.033 meter.\nSo this was the losses in pipe 1.\nWe are going to see the hf2, so major loss\nin pipe 2 will be f2L2 / D2 into V2 square/2g.\nSo f2 is also given 0.02, length is 300 meters\nthat is given into D2 was 0.12 into 1.769\nwhole square/2 into 9.81, that comes out to\nbe 7.97.\nSimilarly, there will be a loss at exit and\nat exit it is simply, V2 square/2g, because\nk here is 1, so 1.769, it is 0.160.\nSo total head loss is going to be 0.174 +\n0.033 + 7.975 + 0.160 and this is going to\nbe 8.342 meter.\nNow the head delivered by the pump Hf will\nbe static head, first it has to overcome this\nstatic head plus the losses.\nSo it is going to be 15 + 8.342, that is,\n23.342 meter.\nTherefore, the power delivered by the pump\nis gamma Q Hf, that is, the total head.\nSo 9.79 into Q is 0.02 into 23.342 kilowatt.\nIf you find 4.57 kilowatt.\nSo the first part we have got this as the\nanswer.\nNow we also have to find the pressure at the\nsuction side of the pump.\nSo for that we are going to use the Bernoullis\nequation and also taking the head loss into\naccount.\nSo part B will be solved by energy equation\nbetween reservoir A and pump B. So let Ps\nbe the pressure at suction side of the pump,\nthen we put the Bernoullis equation 95 + 0\n+ 0 will be equal to, the pump is at z = 100\nand if the pressure Ps/gamma + V1 square/2g\n+ losses in suction pipe.\nSo this will be 100 + Ps/gamma and V1 square/2g\nis going to be 0.065, because V1 we have already\nfound out, plus losses in the suction pipe\nis 0.174 major and the minor losses 0.033.\nThis is major loss, this is minor loss.\nSo Ps/gamma can be found out to be – 5.272\nmeter.\nThis is gauge.\nSo the real pressure is going to be 10 – 5.272,\nbecause we have already been told the absolute\nis 10, so it is going to be Ps = 4.728 multiplied\nby 9.79 to get it into form of kilopascal,\nso 46.29 kilopascal absolute.\nThis is the value that we have got.\nSo both the answers we got.\nNow we proceed next and we solve one more\nproblem.\nA very simple problem, we say a pipe enlarges\nsuddenly from D1 = 240 millimeters to D2 = 480\nmillimeters and the HGL rises by 10 centimeters,\ncalculate the flow in the pipe.\nSo this is V1 and this is V2, so this is 1\nand this is 2.\nSo we are going to solve this as well.\nSo we can write Bernoullis equation p1/rho\ng + V1 square/2g + z1 will be = p2/rho g +\nV2 square/2g + z2 + whatever the head loss\nis.\nSo we take V2 on this side, so we can write\nV1 square/2g – V2 square/2g – hL = p2/rho\ng + z2 – p1/rho g + z1 and.\nSo to find the relation between A1 and V1\nsorry V1 and V2 we can say V1 A1 = V2 A2 which\nwill give us, so the areas are double, so\nwe are going to get V1 = 4V2.\nAnd if we put this in these equations here\nand we also know that this is 0.1 that is\nwhat it says that HGL rises by 0.1.\nTherefore, this will become 16 V2 square,\nthis equation here, by 2g – V2 square/2g\n= 4 V2 – V1 square/2g sorry this is minus\nbecause there was an entrance, you know, head\nloss is, what is this hL, hL is V1 – V2\nwhole square/2g, if you remember the minor\nloss formula, is equal to 0.1 and if you solve\nthis equation, you are going to get 6 V2 square/2g\n= 0.1, which will give V2 as 0.57 meters per\nsecond, implies Q is A2 V2, which will give\n0.103 meter cube per second.\nVery simple formula, the application we have\nseen using Bernoullis equation, equation of\ncontinuity and because there is going to be\na minor loss which is equivalent to V1 – V2\nwhole square/2g.\nAs we have said we have read the minor loss,\nthe topic on the minor losses in the pipes.\nSo we proceed forward from this question.\nSo we talk about pipe networks.\nPipe could be connected in series or parallel\nor combination of both.\nSo this is a serial connection.\nSo in the serial connection the important\nproperties are that discharge Q1 in this section,\nthis section 2, this section 3 will be the\nsame.\nHowever, the total head loss will be the sum\nof the head losses of individual sections,\nwhereas in case of parallel connection the\ndischarge will be the sum of all three.\nSo if there is a discharge Q, Q1, Q2, Q3,\nbut the head losses will be the same in each\nof the pipe.\nSo this is thumb rule, important thing to\nremember when you are dealing with pipe networks.\nSo a water distribution system consists of\ncomplex interconnected pipes, service reservoir\nand or pumps which deliver water from the\ntreatment plant to the consumer.\nThe water demand is highly variable, whereas\nsupply is normally constant.\nThus, the distribution system must include\nstorage element and must be capable of flexible\noperation.\nSo pipe network analysis involves determination\nof pipe flow rates.\nAnd pressure heads at the outflow points of\nthe network.\nThe flow rate and pressure head must satisfy\nthe continuity and the energy equation.\nThis is very true, as I told you in the last\nslide.\nThe earliest systematic method of network\nanalysis is called the Hardy Cross Method\nand is known as the head balance or the close\nloop method.\nSo pipe network is a topic where we are going\nto study this famous method of Hardy Cross\nMethod.\nIt is known as the head balance or the close\nloop method.\nIt is a very, very systematic way which can\nbe used for solving the pipe networks.\nSo this particular method of Hardy Cross is\napplicable to a system in which pipes form\nclosed loops.\nSo the outflow from the system are generally\nassumed to occur at the junction nodes.\nFor a given pipe system with known outflows,\nthe Hardy Cross Method is an iterative procedure\nbased on initially iterated flows in pipes.\nSo Hardy Cross Method has a set rule and procedure,\nbut this is for the solution, it is an iterative\nprocedure.\nSo what are the important points to remember\nin solving pipe networks using Hardy Cross\nMethod?\nThat at each junction the flow must satisfy\nthe continuity criterion.\nWhat are these continuity criterion?\nThe continuity criterion is that the algebraic\nsum of the flow rates in the pipe meeting\nat a junction together with any external flows\nis 0.\nSuppose, this is a node there is Q1, Q2, Q3.\nSo Q1 = Q2 + Q3,\nSo the net outflow at any junction should\nbe 0 is the continuity criterion.\nSecondly, the algebraic sum of head losses\nround each loop must be 0.\nSo sigma of head losses in one loop, like\nthis, should be 0.\nSo with a simple continuity equation we are\ngoing to solve one class question.\nThe equation is a pipe 6 centimeter in diameter\nhere and 1,000 meter long and with lambda\n= 0.018 is connected in parallel, so this\nis pipe 1 and this is pipe 2, between two\npoints M and N and this other pipe is 8 centimeter\nin diameter and 800 meter long.\nSo this was 1,000 meter long, this is 800\nand the diameter was 6 and diameter was 8.\nAnd this has a lambda of 0.020, a total discharge\nof 20 liters per second enters.\nSo from here something 20 liters per second\nenters the parallel pipe through division\nat A and rejoins at B. So it here and it rejoins\nhere.\nEstimate the discharge in each of the pipe,\nvery simple application of the concepts we\nhave learned till now.\nSo we are going to solve this question.\nSo there was pipe, so Q will be = Q1 + Q2.\nSo total discharge is 0.02 and we know the\nareas pi/4 into 0.06 let say velocity is V1\nhere and in the pipe 2 it is V2 0.08 V2.\nSo this is the equation for the continuity\nequation for discharge.\nSo for pipes in parallel we also know that\nthe head losses should be equal in both pipes.\nSo this actually can be written as V1 + 1.778,\nV2 = 7.074, if you solve this, it will come\nthis.\nThis is the one equation that we have got\nfrom here and now hf1 = hf2 which means lambda\n1 L1 V1 square, this is the major loss in\npipe 1 = lambda 2 into L2 into V2 square/2g\nD2.\nSo let us substitute the value, lambda 1 was\n0.018, length was 1,000 first pipe into V1\nsquare/2, so 2g D1 comes out to be 0.06, this\nwill be 0.020 into 800, this comes to be 0.08\ninto V2 square.\nSo taking it here, we will get V1 = 0.8165.\nSo we have two equations in V1 and V2, so\n1 and 2.\nSolving for V2 by substituting V by substituting\n2 in 1, we will get V2 as 2.73 meters per\nsecond.\nSo Q2 will be A2 V2, so pi/4 0.08 whole square\ninto 2.73, so Q2 will come to be 0.0137 meter\ncube per second.\nNow if we know V2, we can get V1 from here,\nV1 will be 0.8165 V2, this will give us V1\nas 2.23 meters per second.\nAnd therefore, Q1 will be A1 V1 will give\nus 0.0063 meter cube per second.\nSo this is the answer, but one important step\nis it is better if we recheck the answer by\nQ1 + Q2, if it is equal to Q or not.\nSo 0.0063 Q1 + 0.0137, it \nis coming out to be 0.020 which is equal to\nQ. So our answer is okay.\nSo this was one other question.\nNow the one more question is there is a horizontal\npipeline which is 50 meters long and is connected\nto reservoir at one end and discharges freely\ninto the atmosphere at the other end.\nSo for the first 25 meters, I have shown this\ndiagram here.\nSo the first 25 meters length from the reservoir,\nthe pipe has a diameter of 15 centimeter and\nit has a square entrance at the reservoir.\nThe remaining 25 meter length of the pipe\nhas a diameter of 30 centimeter, so this is\nthe long, long pipe.\nAnd this is pipe 1, I mean the things that\nwe were talking about, diameter is different\nhere, diameter is different here.\nSo junction of the two pipes is in the form\nof a sudden expansions.\nSo we have been told sudden expansion that\nmeans there is going to be a energy loss,\nminor loss.\nIt is also told that there is going to be\na there is a gate valve in a 15 centimeter\npipe.\nSo there is going to be another minor loss\nhere.\nSo if the height of the water surface in the\ntank is 10 meter above the centerline and\nthe velocity, estimate the discharge in the\npipe by considering the Darcy Weisbach friction\nfactor of 0.02 for both the pipes.\nSo this is given because there will be also\nmajor losses between this two sections, major\nlosses.\nSo we have to, this is a wholesome, a complete\nquestion that involves both the major and\nthe minor losses.\nSo we are going to, actually I think this\nis a nice point to stop.\nIn the next class we are going to solve this\nparticular question in detail because then\nit will be fresh in your mind and then we\nwill proceed to our last topic that is Hardy\nCross Method.\nSo thank you so much for listening.\nI will see you in the next lecture.",
    "video_34": "Welcome back students. In the last class we\nfinished the lecture by introducing a problem\nthat is supposed to be done in the class.\nSo there is a reservoir it is connected to\na pipe, pipe is in two different areas sorry,\nin two different diameters. The length is\nthe total length is 50 meter long, but this\nis 25 centimeter having a different diameter\nand this is having a different diameter. There\nis a sudden expansion, there is a valve here,\nthere is going to be major losses here.\nAnd there is going to be major losses here,\nminor losses will be at this particular point\nhere, here and there will also be going to\nbe a minor loss at the square entrance. So\nthis is a problem where you will get to understand\nand practice all the major and minor head\nlosses again. So that is why I thought it\nto include it as the solved problem, normally\nI give this question in the class test or\nexam for my B.Tech second year students.\nSo I am going to solve this no,w it might\nbe a little lengthy problem, but it is important\nfor you to follow what is going on. So you\nshould try to remember this figure that a\npipe is connected to the reservoir, this is\nthe square entrance, this is the valve, this\nis the sudden enlargement and there is an\nexit. So there is also going to be an exit\nthing, exit loss and the water height, I mean\nthe total height is 10 meters in the reservoir.\nSo solution 14, so the pipe system that we\nhave in question, first we should be able\nto write what all things are there. A it will\nhave minor losses. So what are the minor losses?\nThe first one is the square entrance and the\nhead loss here will be equal to 0.5 v1 square/2g.\nWe have learned this formula, since there\nis a valve, there is a minor loss that is\nequal to K into V1 square/2g, K is already\ngiven in the question as I told you, it is\n0.2 V1 square/2g.\nAnd the third one is sudden expansion, so\nhL, so between 1 and 2, so I call it h12 as\nV1 – V2 whole square/2g and in the end,\nthen we have next there exists friction loss\nhf in pipe 1 and 2, which is given by fL,\ngeneral formula is fL V square by 2 gD and\nalso there exist an exit velocity, exit velocity\nat the end of pipe 2. So this loss of magnitude,\nso entire velocity is loss, so V2 square/2g.\nNow we have listed all the type of losses\nhere. So we have to rewrite the total head\nloss H as, so starting from here it will be\n0.5 V1 square/2g + 0.2 V1 square/2g + so in\nthe pipe 1 there will be one major loss as\nwell fL v1 square/2gD1 + in pipe 2. First\nof all, it will be V1 – sudden expansion\nV1 – V2 square/ 2 g + fL2 V2 square/2gD2.\nThis is the major loss due to the flow and\nin the end there is an exit loss V2 square/\n2g.\nSo we have listed down the energy loss. So\nwe start calculating the different you know,\nso what we can do is, we can you know, so\nwe can start writing here the total head is\n10 meters that is and D1 is because that is\nwhat is going to lose, entire head is going\nto lose 0.15 meter and then there is D2 as\n0.30 meter that we know. So h12 this one sudden\nexpansion is V1 – V2 whole square/2g or\nV2 square/2g/V1 – 1 whole square.\nSo we have written, now there are two velocities\nV1 and V2 and you know what the easiest method\nto find V1 and V2 is the equation of continuity\nand that is what we are going to do next.\nSo we also know that A1 V1 = A2 V2, so A1\nD1 square = A2 D2 square. So using this we\ncan write h12 = V2 square/2g, instead of V1\nsorry A1 V1 = A2 V2 sorry, so this not correct.\nSo we can transform V1 and V2 in form of D2\nand D1. So V2 square/2g, this will become\nD2/D1 whole square – 1 whole square. So\nh12 is going to be V2 square/2g and D2/D1\nwe all know it is 2, so 0.3/0.15 whole square\n– 1 whole square.\nSo h12 we can say, so this is 2 square is\n4, 4 – 1 is 3, 3 square 9. So it will be\n9 into V2 square/2g. So we can simply now\nwrite down the value of H as = 10 as V1/2g\n0.5 + 0.2 + 0.02 into 25/0.15 + V2 square/2g\n9 + 0.02 into 25/0.30 + 1. So 10 = 4.03 V1\nsquare/2g + 11.667 into V2 square/2g and we\nalso know that V1 D1 square = V2 D2 square.\nSo this implies V1 will be V2 into D2/D1 whole\nsquare implies V1 = 4V2.\nSo putting this here we can get 10 = 4.03\ninto 4 square + 11.67 into V2 square/2g that\nis 76.14 into V2 square / 2g and on solution,\nthis is going to give V2 as 1.605 meters per\nsecond and if we know V2 we can simply find\nQ as pi/4 into 0.30 whole square 1.605 that\nwill give us 0.1135 meter cube per second.\nSo you see how we have applied the principles\nof major and minor losses and the equation\nof continuity to solve such a complex problem\nlike this.\nSo we go back and we are going to start what\nwe promised is like, the Hardy Cross Method.\nSo what does the Hardy Cross Method say? So\nif there is a flow like this, there is an\ninflow and there is an outflow you see, and\nthere is a loop that is formed. So what we\ndo? We assign the clockwise flows and their\nassociated head losses as positive. The clockwise\nflows and their associated head losses are\npositive.\nSo what we do is at each nodes we distributes\ncubes and write that delta Q = 0, at each\nnode and we calculate head loss from Q using\nHL = K Q square because you remember head\nloss was K into V square/2g or we can simply\nwrite K Q square/2g A square. So basically\nH can be written as K dash Q square, if you\nbring K/Ag. So our head loss is written like\nthis, K into Q square because head loss is\nproportional to the discharge square.\nIf the head loss = 0 then that means the solution\nis correct. If it is not equal to 0 then we\napply a correction factor delta Q and we go\nto the next step, this delta Q is not arbitrary.\nWe have a led procedure in Hardy Cross Method.\nThat will tell what delta Q is but in principle\ngetting delta HL, sum of all the head losses\nexactly 0 is not possible so we terminate\nthe calculations if we get head loss, if it\nis less than 0.01 meter or delta Q is less\nthan 1 liters per second we stop the calculations\nthere itself. So instead of 0 we go for a\nvery, very small quantity.\nSo a reasonable and efficient value of delta\nQ for rapid convergence is given by this.\nSo this thing you have to remember, delta\nQ is written as minus of sigma head losses/2\nsum of HL/cube. So for each pipe in the loop\nwe are going to calculate head losses, do\nthe summation of it, not only we are going\nto calculate HL, but also the value of HL/cube\nbecause if the sigma head loss is not coming\n0 we will need that value later.\nSo I will just repeat the Hardy Cross Method.\nSo at each node you distribute Q such that\nat each node delta Q should come to 0. It\nshould be an arbitrary Q, of course you should\nsatisfy the continuity equation. Suppose 100\nis coming from there and there are two ways\nyou can say 60-40, 70-30 or 80-20 whatever,\nbut it should satisfy the continuity equation.\nSecond thing you have to do it at all nodes\nin the loop.\nSo once Q is defined here Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 for\nexample, then you start calculating HL. HL\nis k into Q square. This K either you have\nto calculate yourself or it will be given\nalso, both can happen. So you will prepare\na table like this, you see, pipe you will\nsay AB, BC, CD, there are 4 pipes here DE\nfor example, could be. A circular pipe for\nexample, then you need to whatever Q you have\ndistributed you will write it down here, whatever\nthose are.\nYou have to find HL based on this Q and thus\nyou also have to calculate HL/Q for each of\nthese pipes and do the summation here and\ndo the summation here. You have to stop the\ncalculation if this is very near to 0. If\nnot, then we will rely on this value of delta\nHL/Q by this equation, this equation and you\nwill add this delta Q to each of those Qs\nin each pipes.\nSuppose let us say if this pipe was 10, if\nit was 30, it was 20, it was 90 and our delta\nQ comes to be – 5, for example. Then what\nyou do, in the next iteration, so you have\nto repeat this process again and in the next\niteration the first pipe will have 10 + of\n-5. This will have 30 + of – 5. This will\nhave 20 + of – 5 and 90 + of – 5 and then\nyou have to make the table again for each\nof the pipe you have to write Q, you have\nto write HL.\nAnd you have to write HL/Q, do the summation\nhere and you have to stop if this delta HL\ncomes less than 1. So this is the broad explanation\nof Hardy Cross Method. So I think I will stop\nhere now and in our final lecture I will start\nwith the solution of this Hardy Cross problem.\nSo the next lecture is going to be the last\none for this module pipe flows. So thank you\nso much and we will start right from this\nplace. See you in the next lecture.",
    "video_35": "Welcome back students. This is the last lecture\nof this module; pipe flow or viscous pipe\nflow and in the last lecture we have studied\nthe basic concepts of Hardy Cross Method which\nis a way of solving the pipe networks. It\nis an iterative procedure but a very well\nlaid out systematic procedure to solve the\nflow in the pipe. So, currently we have a\nquestion at hand in your, as you can see on\nthe screen.\nA discharge of 100 litres per second is entering\nfrom here and there is an outflow of 20 litres\nper second here, there is an outflow of 40\nlitres per second here and there is again\nan outflow 40 litres per second here and using\nthe Hardy Cross Method, what we have to do;\nwe have to find Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.\nSo, let us start by the, so solution 15, so\nbecause this is the first problem in Hardy\nCross I will write everything. Assume value\nof Q to satisfy continuity equations at all\nnodes. So, there were 4 nodes also the head\nloss is calculated using HL is written as\nK1 Q square, K dash Q square. This HL actually\ncould be sum of major and minor losses both.\nIn current case, we have neglected minor losses,\nI am talking in general.\nSo, h Lm is 0, thus head loss is only hf,\nmajor losses due to friction. Now, this hf\ncan be calculated using Darcy Weisbach equation.\nHow? See, using the Darcy Weisbach equation\nour idea is to arrive at a suitable Q, in\nterms of a suitable K, we want to arrive at\nsomething like this, so that for each of the\npipe we can do that because they are not changing\nthat much.\nSo, hf can be written as lambda L by D into\nV square by 2g, in the question we have been\ngiven that pipes are 1 kilometre long, 300\nmillimetre in dia and lambda or friction factor\nis 0.0163, lambda or F, whatever you want\nto call it. This we have already seen, so\nthe head loss, total H loss is lambda L by\nD V square by 2g, so let us put the values,\nlambda is 0.0163 into length is 1000 meters,\ndiameter is 0.3 meters into V square by 2\ninto 9.81.\nNow, the next step; so, if we do this we are\ngoing to get 2.77 V square, the HL, but we\nneed to have it in form of Q.\nSo, we write HL is 2.77 V square or 2.77 Q\nsquare by A square, so 2.77 Q square. What\nis area? Area is nothing but pi by 4 into\n0.3 whole square to whole square, so this\ncomes to be 554 Q square. So, you see this\nis our expression for HF or HL, where K we\nhave seen is 554, we have derived because\nall the properties of the pipe were given.\nSo, now we make the, so we, what we do is;\nlet us say for the first iteration, this is\npoint A, this is point B, this is point C\nand this is point D.\n100 litres were coming here, this is given\nfirst and then we say 20 litres per second\nand this is 40 litres per second. Let us say\nwhen 100 is coming, this pipe AB gets 60,\nlike this and this say is 40 and AD is in\nthis direction 40 and therefore this will\nbe, so 40 comes 40 goes out and this will\nbe 0, this is our first assumption, we are\nnot saying this is the correct answer.\nBut let us say, this is the first assumption\nwe have used the equation of continuity at\neach of these nodes, this is what we have\ndone. So, as I said first make a table like\nthis and we write pipe name here, we write\nQ into litres per second, we also write head\nloss in meters and we also find HL by Q, these\nare the 4 things, so 1, 2, 3 and 4. So, let\nus write AB, BC, CD and AD.\nThis we have already found, done through using\nthe equation of continuity, so we simply write\ndown 60, 40, 0, -40, you see that the clockwise\nwe have assumed positive that is why AD is\nminus 40 and using 554 Q square and converting\nit into meter cube per second because it is\ngiven in litre, the head loss is going to\nbe; you do the calculation 554 into 60 whole\nsquare divided by 1000, it will come out to\nbe 2.0.\nAnd this will come out to be 0.886, since\nthis is 0, this will be 0 and this comes – 0.886.\nYou also calculate 2 by 60 in meters, so I\nmean 2 by 60 because this is in meter, this\nis in litre second, so we calculate HL by\nQ 0.033, this will come 0.0222, this will\ncome 0 and this will come 0.0222 same, fine.\nSo, we have to do the summation here, we have\nto find the summation of only these 2 quantities.\nIf you sum this, you will find, this is HL\nis 2.0 and HL by Q is coming to be 0.0774,\nso since the sigma of head loss is greater\nthan 0.01, a correction factor has to be applied.\nAnd what is that correction factor? We know\nthe formula, the formula is - HL divided by\n2 times sigma HL by Q and this will come out\nto be – 2 divided by 2 into 0.0774 or – 12.92\nlitres per second.\nSo, delta Q will come to be – 12.92 litres\nper second. Now, this delta Q that we have\nobtained should be applied to discharges before\nthe next trial here. So, this 60 will become\n60 – 12.92, this will become 40 – 12.92,\n0 will become 0 – 12.92 and 40 will also\nbecome 40 – 12.92. So, I will not rub the\nentire thing but I will rub the right hand\nside, so now this is the second trial.\nSo, Q here will be 60 – 12.92 because delta\nQ was negative, so it becomes 47. 08, first\nstep is to write down the values after the\ncorrection, - 12.92 and this – 52.92. Similarly\nHL if we calculate, we will get 1.23, we get\n0.407, we get 0.092 and we get – 1.555 because\nHL is 554 into Q square and HL by Q, this\nHL by Q 1.23 divided by 47.08, if you use\nthe calculator, 0.0261, 0.015, 0.007, 0.0294.\nAnd if you do this sum, this is going to be\n-0.010 and this is 0.07775, so as sigma HL\nis approximately equal to 0.01, this is okay.\nTherefore, these will be the final discharges\nin the pipe AB, BC, CD and AD. So, AB is going\nto be 47 approximately, I am writing, 27,\nthis is 13 and this is 53. Of course, this\nis with minus sign and this is also with minus\nsign considering clockwise as positive.\nSo, this concludes our solution to this particular\nquestion on Hardy Cross Method, you see how\nwe have calculated K that was 554 and applied\nthis.\nSo, we will see yet another question and that\nwill be the last question that we are going\nto solve in the class. But before finishing\nthis lecture I will give you a problem that\nyou will have to attempt at home and will\nbe based on Hardy Cross Method. So, this is\nthe network that is, so okay, so this is the\nclass problem. So, this is the network given\nbelow, the discharge at the nodes are known.\nSo, instead of K, we say R, you see here we\nhave given the values of R here, R, R, everything\nis given, so you do not have to worry about\ncalculating the major or the minor head loss,\neverything has been given here. So, these\ndischarges at the nodes are known, so 100\nis coming inside here, this 25 is leaving\nhere, 50 is leaving, this is 25 B that we\ndo not know.\nThe, if not, so we have to check if these\nvalues, so we have been given that AB is here\nis given 60, BC is 19 is given, CA is 40,\nBE is given 41, ED is given 16 and DC is given\n34, we simply have to check that if this satisfies.\nSo, there are 2 things that need to be checked.\nSo, the first thing is that the continuity\nequation is satisfied or not and second thing\nwe have to check of course, this is going\nto satisfy the continuity equation, 60 is\ncoming, 41 is going, 19 is coming here.\nHere, see, 34 is coming, 19 is coming, so\n19, 30 + 34 is coming and 25 and 40 are leaving,\nI think, there is a little problem here, DC\n34, ED 16 but anyways, whatever these values\nare we have to check the Hardy Cross Method,\nif it is applicable there or not. So, the\ncontinuity equation actually this should not\nbe, so 19 it should be 20, 19, if it is like\nthis, because if 100 is coming here, then\n60 is going, 40 is coming here.\nWe have to readjust the values a little bit\nhere, but more important is the procedure\nthat we are going to adopt here. So, let us\nstart with the solution. So, as you see there\nare 2 loops; one is loop 1 and one is loop\n2, it seems by this that these actually, they\nare not going to satisfy this because the\ncontinuity equation itself is not satisfied\nbecause first and foremost thing is this,\nthis, this and this should be satisfied.\nSo, based on the figure here, it does not\nseem to get satisfied but I will lay out the\nprocedure for solving these types of questions.\nSo, the solution for this type of question\nis, the suggested discharge must satisfy continuity\nequation at all nodes, each node that is the\nfirst thing. Second thing, the flow direction\nis assumed positive clockwise. Third is you\nhave to calculate HL as r Q square here and\nwe also have to calculate delta Q as minus,\nyou know, sigma HL divided by 2 sigma HL by\nQ.\nSo, we have to make tables, like this for\nboth the loops. I am just laying out the procedure\nhere, so the lines are going to be; lines\nhere will be AB, BC, CA, there is going to\nbe Q that you have assumed and then you have\nr Q square, then or HF is equal to and then\nyou have sigma HF by sigma HL by 2, sorry,\nthis is sigma HL by Q. Similarly, here, there\nwill be 4 lines, in the second loop there\nare 4, lines will be BC, CD, DE and EB.\nAnd you have to have written Q, you have to\ncalculate r Q square and then r Q square by\nsigma of Q fine. So, this is what you have\nto calculate. In the current problem, we clearly\nsee that the continuity equation is not satisfied\nat all. Therefore, this means that in the\nquestion, the question is the question it\nsays is if we have to check if it is satisfactory,\nwe simply our answer is not satisfactory.\nWe did not even need to go to the second step,\nin the first step because the continuity equation\nwas not satisfied therefore we can simply\nsay that the solutions are not acceptable.\nSo, this we have done because we found out\nthe continuity equation was not satisfied\nat this point. So, we have seen 2 types of\nproblems in Hardy Cross, the problems can\nbe made very complicated.\nBut since, this was a lot of time, if there\nwill be questions, those questions are going\nto be quite simple in nature, easy calculations\nbut you should be knowing, what the procedures\nfor Hardy Cross Methods are to be able to\nsolve those problems. If a full problem is\ngiven, then the problem will be divided into\nlot of many parts like at least, it will carry\n5 or 10 points out of let us say 50.\nBut I will try to give you easy questions\nwhere the solutions are not so complex. So,\nbefore we end, there is a homework problem.\nSo, the homework problem is there is the network\nshown in this figure and the head loss is\ngiven by, I mean the head loss, you know,\nis like r Q square. The values of r for each\npipe is given, here, here and the discharges\ninto or out of the various nodes are shown.\nSo, 20 is entering here, so the things are\ngiven. The discharges are in arbitrary unit.\nSo, obtain the distribution of the discharges\nin the network. So, you have to solve this\nquestion, see there are 2 loops; loop 1 and\nthen loop 2. So, each of these loop must be\nsatisfied, it is a long problem, it will require\nat least 30 minutes of your time to solve\nthis but I think before you start the lecture\non the viscous flow next week, it is good\nhomework problem to solve.\nSo, I think this is the point where I will\nend the lecture on viscous pipe flows. Thank\nyou so much for listening and next week, we\nare going to start viscous pipe flow continued\nby computational fluid dynamics and in the\nend, we would wind up the course with inviscid\nflow or we will derive the basic wave mechanics.\nThank you so much for listening and I will\nsee you next week.",
    "video_36": "Welcome students. So, this is the week 10,\nlecture number 1, here we are going to study\nabout the topic that is mentioned in this\nslide, this is about viscous fluid flow. Actually,\nyou have, we have gone through this topic\nbefore but in a much more crude manner. The\nmain objective of this module is going to\nbe able to derive Navier Stokes equation from\nscratch, so how to start from the beginning\nand derive the Navier Stokes equation.\nAnd we are expecting to dedicate around depends\nbut at least 3 to 4 lectures in this module\nand our difference from the regular classes\nto this one is going to be that I will be\nteaching it by hand, we will take the help\nof slides as little as possible, because Navier\nStokes equation is something that needs to\nbe done by hand and in the derivation using\nthe slide, it has been found out it is not\nhelpful that much for this particular thing.\nSo, we will go very slow in this and we will\ncomplete this module in lecture 3 to 4, so\nnow I will minimize this and use this board\nnow.\nSo, this is you know, the topic is viscous\nfluid flow so, I will be speaking too, because\nI think my writing might not be that much\nhelpful to you, so to start with this one,\nsome general, you know points; one is a fluid\nis a substance that deforms continuously under\nthe action of a shear force, this means, it\ncannot resist shear. A solid however, can\nresist shear and remain at rest.\nIn fluid mechanics, a matter is classified\ninto fluids and non-fluids. So, in thermodynamics,\nthe normal definition is classification in\nsolids, liquids and gases. But in fluid mechanics,\nit is fluids which consists of gases and liquids\nand non-fluids; non-fluids are mostly the\nsolids. So, another basic revision is properties\nof fluid, so first is kinematic property,\nthat is, velocity, acceleration, vorticity,\nrate of strain, angular velocity etc.\nSo, there are many other properties like this\nkinematic. Transport properties, you know,\nare viscosity, thermal conductivity, mass\ndiffusivity. Thermodynamic properties like\ndensity, pressure, temperature, entropy, enthalpy\netc. So, we will go to another page.\nAnd the; there are some other miscellaneous\nproperties. Miscellaneous properties includes\nsurface tension, it is important to know these\nproperties, at least know what those are vapour,\npressure, see whatever properties I have just\nmentioned if you know what those are your\nknowledge of fluid mechanics is complete,\neddy diffusion coefficient. So, apart from\nthat so, these are the some of the properties.\nSo, now we go into little bit more detail\nin kinematic properties. So, the idea of this\nparticular lecture today is that we are going\nto write what actually material derivatives\nare and we see the rotation you know how the\nfluid particle gets rotated and try to obtain\nthe strain rates and those quantities that\nis the main objective of today's lecture.\nSo, first thing is substantial derivative\n/ material derivative.\nSo, we are just going to mention what that\nis, so if we say, let Q x, y, z, t is any\nfluid property \nand V bar is equal to u x, y, z, t i cap +\nv x, y, z, t j cap + w x, y, z, t k cap denote\nthe velocity field. So, if we assume Q is\nany property, any fluid property and V given\nas ui cap + vj cap, wk cap denotes the velocity\nfield, then total derivative of Q, that is,\nd Q, so dQ will be given as del Q del x into\ndx + del Q by del y into dy + del Q del z\ninto dz + del Q del t into dt.\nHence, time rate of change of the property\nQ is given by dQ by dt is equal to, so del\nQ del x is there and this dx by dt, this becomes\ndx by dt into dy by dt + del Q by del z into\ndz by dt + del Q del t into dt by dt. So,\nwhat we have done is we have divided this\nby dt.\nSo, going to the next page, so finally we\ncan write dQ dt is given by, because dx dt\nbecomes u; u del Q del x + v del Q del y +\nw del Q del z + del Q del t. So, this dQ dt\nis called substantial derivative, usually\nwritten as dQ dt. These 3 are convective derivative\nand this is local derivative, so this is substantial\nor material derivative, this is convective\nderivative and this is the local derivative.\nSo, starting with a new, you know, so if there\nis a fluid element \ncan undergo the following 4 types of motion\nor deformation. What are those? Of course,\nit can do translation; translation is moving\nfrom one point to the other, it can do rotation;\nit can do extensional strain or also dilation\nand shear strain.\nSo, we are going to derive something which\nwe, so we are going to derive the strain rates,\nso one thing I would like to take your attention\nto, is this figure. So, we consider a fluid\nelement A, B, C, D, so we consider this element\nA, B, C, D and that moves in an xy plane,\nthe position of this element at times t, this\nis position at time t and its position at\ntime t + dt is shown like this.\nSo, now with reference to the above figure,\nwe can observe the following transformations,\nI mean, of transformation or deformation in\nthe fluid element within the time interval\nof t + dt. See, we can see that B has translated\nfrom B to B dash, we can also see that this\ndiagonal BD has rotated anti-clockwise to\nB dash, D dash, you see that, and we can also\nsee the dilation or the extensional strain\nof the element.\nBecause of rotation, you know, these elements,\nsome of these will dilate and some of them\nwill elongate. So, now using this figure we\nare going to write down, so we will keep this\nhandy and start deriving.\nSo, we can see from the figure that I showed\nyou, we can say tan d alpha is equal to del\nv del x into dx dt divided by dx + del u del\nx dx dt. So, let me go back to this figure\nand try to explain you some of these components\nhere. You see, so this was length dx, when\nit goes there, you know, if we consider in\ntime dt and with the velocity u.\nSo, this entire length will become dx plus,\nso change of velocity in x direction, if it\nis del u del x, if it is del u del x, then\nthe total change, this length is going to\nbe del u del x into dx into you know dt. So,\nthis is the total distance that this is going\nto be there and the translation that this\nwill have, this one is going to be only, see\nthis was at origin, I mean, this was at 0\nbefore.\nSo, it will be del v del y, so it would have\nalso, it has traversed over a length x, so\ndx into dt, similarly from here to here you\nsee dy, so it was already at y, so this length\nis dy plus the rate of change of v in y direction,\nso del v del y into dy dt. Similarly, this\nwill be only del u del y into dy dt. I hope\nyou have understood, so there are angles d\nalpha and d beta which we are going to calculate.\nSo, the translation because it is u dt, you\nsee, this translation from this point to this\npoint in time dt is considered to be u dt\nand this one it has a velocity u in this direction\nand this one, this fluid particle has a velocity\nv in this direction, so this has translated\nto, u dt and v dt, if it was 0, 0 here. So,\nthis is done using geometry only, so a fluid\nparticle having velocity u and v respectively\nin x and y direction translates that rotate\nalso you know because of the shear.\nSo, this particular figure we are going to\nsee, we are going to derive some important\nresults about it. So, tan d alpha you see,\nI am not going to open it all the time, so\nI will show you here, so this is d alpha here,\nso this is d alpha and this is d beta. So,\ntan d alpha was del v del x into dx dt divided,\njust simple geometry. And what is going to\nbe tan beta?\nTan d beta is going to be del u by del y into\ndy dt divided by dy + del v by del y into\ndy dt, simple trigonometric rule. So, for\ninfinitesimally small time interval dt, if\nthe time interval is very small that is dt,\nwe can obtain tan d alpha is d alpha is limit,\ndt goes to 0 tan inverse of del v by del x\ninto dx dt divided by dx + del u del x into\ndx dt.\nThis implies, d alpha is limit dt goes to\n0 tan inverse, so we divide by dx, so this\nwill be del v del x into dt divided by 1 +\ndel u del x dt, we just cancelled dx from\nup and down and in this case, what is going\nto happen is; because dt is very small, this\nis going to be 1 plus, this is going to be\n1 and it will be del v by del x because this\nwill be approximately equal to 1, del v dt.\nSo, similarly, the way we obtained d alpha,\nd beta is also going to be del u del y into\ndt, this is another important results, del\nu and del beta. So, now, the rotation of the\nelement is given by the arithmetic mean of\nthe angular velocities of sides BC and BA.\nFurther, the \nrotations d alpha and d beta are in opposite\nsense. Hence, the rate of rotation in the\nz direction considering the anti-clockwise\nrotation as positive is given by; so rate\nof rotation in the z direction is given by\nd in z direction, is given by, simple.\nSo, the rotation of the element it was given\nby the arithmetic mean of the angular velocities\nof sides BC and BA, which is 1/2 d alpha dt\n- d beta dt, here we have assumed that the\nanti-clockwise rotation is positive, so because\nd alpha by dt and d beta by dt, we have found\nout from the previous, you see, d beta, so\nif you see using this one for example, d beta\nby dt can be written as del u by del y.\nSo, we can simply write, del alpha by del\nt is del v by del x and this will be del u\nby del y.\nSo, similarly \nfor x and y directions, simply we write sigma\nx by dt is equal to 1/2, so we have found\nout for z, same way we can find out for del\nw by del x, sorry, del w by del y - \ndel v by del z and \nso d sigma y by dt is 1/2 del u by del z - del\nw by del x. So, let us call this equation\nnumber 3 and the other 2 equations, you know,\nso let us say this is 1 and this was equation\nnumber 2.\nSo, equations 1 to 3 can be actually written\nin vector form as, because there are 3 components,\nwe can simply write; is equal to 1/2, so I\nwould like to close the lecture at this point\nand we will resume from this particular page\nin our next one. Thank you so much. See you\nin the next lecture.",
    "video_37": "Welcome back students.\nSo, this second lecture of viscous fluid flow,\nso where we are in the end going to derive\nthe Navier-stokes equation but to be able\nto derive that we had to learn basic properties\nabout the material derivative.\nAnd also the rotation, what is rotation, how\nthis angle is rotated, so we started from\nbasics and until now we have derived that\nthe rotation per unit time is given in a vector\nform as this, that was where we concluded\nin the last lecture.\nSo, we will continue now, so this is, so there\nis a term called the vorticity.\nSo, the vorticity of the fluid, this is actually\nthe rate of rotation, this above equation,\nwhich let us say, I will name it as equation\nnumber 4.\nSo, the vorticity of fluid given by omega\nin vector form is defined as curl of the velocity\nvector.\nHence, so this is the vorticity definition\nand this is; so, if you see, our angle of\nrotation here is half of the vorticity, it\nis actually 1/2 del cross v and vorticity\nis actually twice of that, so we can simply\nwrite 2, so this is another important result,\nwhich we have proved that vorticity is twice.\nBecause the rate of rotation we already derived\nand found out to be 1/2 of the curl, of the\nvelocity vector, so we will go to the next\npage to continue.\nSo, you know already for irrotational flow,\nomega is actually 0, because that is in; that\nis the vorticity vector should be 0.\nNow, the 2 dimensional shear strain \nis the average decrease of the angle between\nthe sides AB and BC, in this figure.\nIf you remember this figure, AB and BC, you\nknow, so the 2 dimensional shear strain is\nthe average decrease of the angle between\nthe side AB and BC.\nSo, we can define, this is the average, so\nthat is the 2 dimensional shear strain is\naverage of, so 1/2 of d alpha dt + d beta\ndt, because that is the decrease of the angle\nor in other forms, we get del v del x because\nd alpha dt was del v del x and this was del\nu by del y.\nSimilarly, 2 other components of, so this\nis actually shear strain rate, so using, drawing\nthe analogy, epsilon xy, we already wrote,\nso epsilon yz can be written as, same way,\n1/2 del w del y + del v del z and epsilon\nzx is equal to; so we have written epsilon\nyz and epsilon zx in a similar fashion.\nSo, I will go to the next page, so the dilatational;\ndilatation or extensional, dilatation or extensional\nstrain is defined as the ratio of the; see,\nthe dilation or the extensional strain is\ndefined as the rate of the change in length\nto the original length, this sort of a similar\ndefinition you would also remember from your\nthermodynamics class in class 12th.\nSo, along x direction, the original length\nwas dx.\nAnd the increased length at time t + dt is\nwhich if you look at that diagram you would\nsee del u del x into dx dt.\nHence, the change in length is del u del x\ninto dx dt.\nThis implies, the rate of linear is given\nby, that was shear and this is linear, del\nu by del x into dx dt divided by dx dt, implied\ndel u del x, so epsilon xx is del u del x.\nSimilarly, along y and z direction, epsilon\nyy can be written as del v by del y and epsilon\nzz can be written as del w by del z.\nSo, the extensional and shear strain rates,\ntaken as together, form a second order symmetric\ntensor epsilon ij given by; so, epsilon ij,\nsee, this is quite important, so we have actually\nfound out the values in terms of del v, del\nv del x, del v del y, del v del z, another\nsimilar components.\nSo, what we have done here, we have written\nthe total shear strain rates and we have found\nout that epsilon xx was del u del x, epsilon\nyy was del v del y, epsilon zz was del w del\nz and similarly, we also found out the shear\nepsilon xy, epsilon yz and epsilon zx, 1/2\nof del v del x + del u del v del y, del u\ndel y, so these are the relations which we\nhave been successfully able to you know find.\nSo, in the next lecture, so I think this is\nthe point is a good point to end the lecture\ntoday and in the next class, we will start\nby deriving some of the equations, starting\nwith the equation of continuity and then going\nto momentum, proceeding to Navier-stokes equations.\nThanks for attending the, listening to the\nlecture today and I will see you in the next\nclass.",
    "video_38": "Welcome back students, to this week's and\nmodule’s lecture.\nSo, in the last 2 lectures we have gone through\nlooked at the basic fluid properties, then\nwe derived the rate of shear strain and this\nis an important property, which we are going\nto use in our further analysis.\nSo, we are going to, so this is the last point\nwhere we concluded, written the extensional\nand the shear strain rates, extensional is\nepsilon xx, epsilon yy and epsilon zz.\nWhereas, the shear strain rates are epsilon\nxy, epsilon xz and epsilon zy, so this is\nthe matrix of the strain rates and the values\nof epsilon xx, epsilon yy and epsilon zz,\nwe had already derived that epsilon xx was\ndel u by del x and similarly, epsilon yy was\ndel v del y and epsilon zz was del w del z.\nSo, after that we are going to start the classification\nof fundamental equations.\nSo, actually there are 3 laws of conservation\nof physical systems.\nThe first one is conservation of mass, this\nyou have already seen that is \ncontinuity equation.\nThe second one is, the second conservation\nequation is conservation of momentum \nand this is analogous to Newton's second law.\nThe third is conservation of energy and this\nhas something to do with first law of thermodynamics.\nSo, the 3 unknowns \nthat must be obtained simultaneously from\nabove 3 basic equations \nare velocity, second is pressure, so writing\nV, pressure which is thermodynamic by p and\nT as temperature, absolute temperature, given\nby T. So, we actually consider 2 independent,\nso when it comes to thermodynamic variables,\nwe consider 2 independent thermodynamic variables,\nwhich are actually pressure and temperature.\nHowever, the final form of \nconservation equations \nalso contains 4 other thermodynamic variables.\nAnd what are those variables?\nWe are going to write it down, one is Rho\nalso called density, second is H, that is,\nenthalpy, there is mu viscosity and K thermal\nconductivity.\nSo, we go to the next page, so we assume something\nand that assumption is that we assume that\nthere is a thermodynamic equilibrium.\nSo, under the \nassumption of thermodynamic equilibrium rho\nis; rho as a function of pressure and temperature,\nh is also a function of pressure and temperature,\nso mu is equal to; mu is also function of\npressure and temperature and K that is the\nthermal conductivity, K is also the; so basically,\nall these independent, I mean, dependent variable\nare a function of pressure and temperature\nunder thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThese values; so which values; these values,\nrhos, h, mu and K, these are these values\nare generally in form of tables, charts or\nsome theoretical or in theoretical, you know,\nformula.\nUsually in hydraulics for our purposes, you\nknow, rho, mu, K are assumed constant and\nh is proportional to temperature.\nSo, in this particular course, we are going\nto deal mainly with the rho and mu, which\nwill be considered constant.\nSo, the discussions above; so, the above consideration\napplies to a fluid of uniform \nhomogeneous composition, which means diffusion\nand chemical reactions \nare not considered.\nSo, with this background in mind, we will\nget started with our first equation.\nSo, our first equation is conservation of\nmass or also called equation of continuity,\nso actually all the 3 laws for the derivation\nrequire the particle derivative or a substantial\nderivative or the material derivative, which\nwe have already seen in our lecture, I mean,\nprevious lectures.\nSo, I will take you to that where we wrote\nthe material derivative.\nSo, here, so a material derivative of any\nquantity is written as dQ dt as del Q del\nt + u del Q del x + v del Q del y + w del\nQ del z, so this is the material derivative.\nSo, we are going back to; so the 3 laws including\nthis one, the 3 laws of conservation utilized\nthe particle substantial derivatives.\nSo, that is, D Dt is equal to del del t plus,\nso this is what we utilize, actually in this\nparticular course, we are going to deal with\nonly the conservation of mass and conservation\nof momentum.\nThe third equation; the first law of thermodynamics,\nthe conservation of energy is outside the\nscope, so we are not going to deal with that\nin this particular course, but for the people\nwho study mechanical engineering that law\nis also very much applicable.\nSo, writing now, law of conservation of mass.\nSo, what does this law says?\nLaw of conservation of mass, we said that\nthis particular equation is will be used for\nthe derivation of this equation of continuity.\nSo, the law of conservation of mass says that\nmass is equal to rho and this is V, I am writing\na different V, because V we mostly say in\nhydraulics, v as velocity, so this is constant,\nso that is conservation of mass.\nSo, this equation we call 1 for now and this\nequation we will call equation number 2.\nSo, if we put equation number 2 in equation\nnumber 1, this becomes del D m/ D t is equal\nto 0, is equal to by chain rule rho.\nNow, this you see, there are 2 terms on the\nright hand side, rho DV Dt + VD rho Dt, where\nV is the volume.\nSo, actually the rate of change of volume;\nso, the total change in volume, so DV Dt can\nbe related to the fluid velocity.\nHow?\nIf we notice that the \nnormal strain rate is equal to rate of volume\nincrease of a particle per unit volume.\nSo, the normal strain rate actually is equal\nto the rate of volume increase of a particle\nper unit volume, so we go to another page.\nThat means, epsilon xx + epsilon yy + epsilon\nzz is equal to; this is the definition 1 by\nV DV Dt, so we also know that this is equal\nto; from our previous lectures derivation,\nepsilon xx was del u del x, epsilon yy was\ndel v del y and this was epsilon zz was del\nw del z, this was what we actually had derived\nand this actually is nothing but divergence\nof V or this; so this is the velocity, because\nit is u, v, w.\nAnd this equation we call equation number\n4, combining equations 1 to 4 to eliminate\nthis volume.\nWhat we can get?\nWe will get; so, we are going to get D Rho\nDt + rho divergence of V, so this is velocity\nV not the volume V is equal to 0.\nSo, this is equation number 5.\nIf we assume incompressible flow, then \nreduces to divergence of V is equal to 0 and\nthis is nothing but equation of continuity.\nSo, what we have done is; we have been able\nto derive the equation of continuity.\nSo, we; and this is equation number 6, so\nwe look at a related concept called stream\nfunction now.\nWhat is stream function?\nIf the continuity equation reduces to only\n2 nonzero terms, then it can be satisfied\nidentically and replaced by so called stream\nfunction, which is given by psi.\nSo, continuity equation in 2D, let us call\nit xy plane, steady compressible flow \nis written as, so it is steady that means\nthere is not going to be any del del t term.\nSo, we will have only del del x, because it\nis compressible, del del y of rho v is equal\nto 0, this is equation number 7.\nIf we define the stream function psi such\nthat rho u is del psi by del y and rho v is\n- del psi by del x, so first we have written\nthe continuity equation in 2 dimension and\nif we are defining a function which we will\ncall stream functions such that it satisfies\nrho u is equal to del psi by del y and rho\nv as del psi by; - del psi by del x.\nThen, if we substitute equation 8 in equation\n7, we observe, we see that equation number\n7 is satisfied identically.\nOf course, the condition here is; psi is continuous\nto second order derivatives.\nBefore we conclude I would like to you know\njust look at it.\nHow?\nSo, del del x rho u.\nHow, I mean, by how is it satisfied identically?\nSo, rho u is del psi del x, so it will be\ndel del x of; sorry, plus del del y of rho\nv is minus del psi del x, so this means, so\nLHS and RHS was so; so \nI think this is right time to finish today's\nlecture and we start from where we are going\nto; we start in the next lecture from where\nwe have just stopped.\nAnd thank you for listening.\nI will see you in the next lecture.",
    "video_39": "Welcome back student so, in the last lecture\nwe have seen that the stream function satisfies\nidentically the continuity equation, so now\nwe are going to proceed forward so, this was\nthe place where we left off and we are going\nto start now, okay.\nSo, why, what is the importance of a stream\nfunction?\nThis helps us to disregard \ncontinuity equation and therefore, this means\nthe stream function.\nAnd therefore, the number of dependent variables\nis reduced by 1, secondly there is a disadvantage\nto it as well, the disadvantage is that remaining\nvelocity derivatives are increased by 1 order\nbecause as you see this is del square term,\nso therefore this is one of the disadvantages\nbut on the other hand, the advantage is that\nthe number of dependent variables were reduced\nby 1.\nNow, what is the physical significance of\nstream function?\nSo, to look at it; if you see psi can be written\nas del psi del x into dx + del psi into del\ny to dy alright, this is how del psi can be\nwritten and you see del psi by del x we have\ndefined, minus rho v, equation number 8, we\nuse equation number 8, so it becomes - rho\nv dx + del psi by del y was rho u dy alright,\nso this is nothing but this is rho v; velocity\nwill remain v, we are writing as vector into\nthe area vector, alright.\nAnd this whole is mass flow rate, so this\nimplies actually that lines of constant psi\nare lines across which there is no mass flow\nthat is they are streamlines of the flow.\nSo, you are noticing in this particular module\nthe way of approaching the streamlines and\nthe continuity equation has been very different,\nwe have started from scratch and tried to\nshow what we have learnt in our fluid mechanics\nclass.\nSecondly, the difference between the values\nof psi of any 2 streamlines is numerically\nequal to mass flow between those stream lines,\nalright.\nSo, this is are the 2 physical significance\nof stream function that the long lines of\nconstant psi are lines across which there\nis no mass flow and also the difference between\nthe values of psi across any 2 streamline\nis numerically equal to the mass flow between\nthose 2 stream lines, alright.\nSo, this concludes our continuity equation\nnow, we are going to the conservation of mass.\nSo, I think it is the right time to start\nthe new page, alright.\nSo, we write conservation of mass okay, Newton's\nsecond law of motion states that F is equal\nto mass into acceleration, so let us divide\nso, I am again writing equation number 1 because\nwe have started a new topic, we call this\nconservation of mass so, this is equation\nnumber 1 in conservation of mass.\nSo, if we divide \nequation number 1 with volume, so volume we\nare all; in this module we are denoting by\nV.\nSo, this becomes F by V is equal to small\ns is rho DV Dt, correct so, that is force\nper unit volume or we can also write rho DV\nDt is equal to force small f and that can\nbe written as; there are 2 type of forces;\none is body force plus one is surface force\nand this equation we write as equation number\n2, alright.\nSo, this f \nis applied force per unit volume on fluid\nparticle, alright so, what is f body, we have\nto clarify that a little bit so, f body, so\nbasically this is body force so, body forces\nare those that apply to the entire mass of\nthe fluid element, okay.\nSuch forces are usually due to external fields\nsuch as gravity or an applied electromagnetic\npotential, okay.\nSo, currently \nmagneto hydrodynamics effects; so magneto\nhydrodynamics; hydrodynamics is dynamics,\nfluid dynamics for example, right and which\nis caused by the magnetic force, so these\ntype of forces; magneto hydrodynamic effects\nare ignored in current course okay, current\nmodule basically and we consider only the\ngravitational body forces, okay.\nSo, f body is written as rho g, alright and\nthis we called as equation number 3, alright.\nNow, the other fourth is f surface; surface\nforce so, first the definition; surface forces\nare those applied by external stresses on\nthe sides of the element.\nThis quantity that is stress, tau ij is a\ntensor, so surface forces are those that are\napplied by external stresses on the side of\nthe element and this is called tau ij, will\nwrite it in a much, alright and this tau ij\nis a tensor, okay.\nSo, let us draw a figure, I am not very good\nat drawing but I will try, alright.\nSo, what we assume this dimension as x, alright,\nthis has been assumed y and this side it is\nz axis, alright.\nSo, these stresses on the side needs to be\nrepresented alright, so this is x side, so\nthe normal stress here is going to be tau\nxx alright, so the shear stress on the this\nface but going in y direction is called tau\nxy, right.\nSo, this particular face and the one that\nis acting here is tau zx.\nSo, if we similarly, write on the y surface\nalright, so this is the y surface where you\nknow this is the; alright so, the up side\nis going to be tau yy alright, this is going\nto be tau yx and this side it is going to\nbe tau yz.\nIf we write on this surface so, on this surface,\nit is going to be tau zy because this is z\nsurface tau zz and this is tau zx because\nit is in x direction, alright.\nSo, tau ij is the stress in the j direction\non a face normal to i axis, okay.\nSo, this has been our definition; tau ij stress\nin the j direction on a face that is normal\nto i axis alright, so we said that a stress;\nthis is a tensor correct.\nSo, we need to write down; we actually have\nwritten down tau ij in that figure that I\nwill write it down, tau xx, you remember this\nsimilar type of tensor we had found in a strain,\nin the last one, I mean 2 lectures from now,\nI mean 2 lectures before okay, so here tau\nij is equal to tau ji and what is this, what\nis the reason for symmetry?\nIt is required to satisfy equilibrium of moments\nabout the axes of the element.\nSo, this symmetry is required to satisfy the\nequilibrium of moments about the axis of the\nelements.\nSo, let us consider; so considering front\nfaces of the element in figure above; actually,\nwe wrote those stresses in the front you know,\nin the front faces itself, we try to write\nthe total force in each direction due to stress\nso, dFx, in x direction so, tau xx is in this\ndirection and is acting over the plane which\nis having an area of dy dz, I should actually\nshow you once for this one.\nSo, if you see tau xx is acting in this direction;\nx direction also, tau yx is acting in x direction\nand tau zx is also acting in this direction\nand multiplied by the corresponding so, tau\nxx acts on area of dy dz, tau yx acts on area\nof dx dz and tau zx is acting on the area\nof dx dy alright.\nSo, dFx is tau yx dx dz + tau zx dx dy, so\nsimilarly, in y direction which write down\nthe sum of \nthe tau xy into dy dz + tau yy dx dz + tau\nzy dx dz, tau zy into dx dy.\nAnd similarly, dFz is written as tau xz into\ndy dz + tau yz dx dz + tau zz into dx dy and\nthis all 3 equation we call as equation number\n4, alright.\nSo, for an element in equilibrium, these forces\nwould be balanced by equal and opposite \non the backsides, right.\nSo, if the element is in equilibrium, the\nforces that we have written dFx, dFy, dFz\nthese forces would should be balanced by equal\nand opposite I mean, forces on the backside,\nwe have written the front faces alright, back\nsides of the element alright.\nLet us say just assume if the element is actually;\nif the element is accelerating let us say,\nit is accelerating, okay.\nSo, that means the forces are not balanced,\naccelerating, okay then, front and back faces\nforces or stresses will be different by some\namount okay, some differential amount okay,\nso suppose tau xx front, it is going to be\ntau xx back, this is what it means, tau xx,\nx sorry, you know this, so tau xx x dx into\ndel x into dx, we call this equation number\n5, alright.\nHence, net force on element in x direction\nwill be dFx net will be the differential right,\nso that is going to be now, del tau xx x dx\ninto dx, this is the differential stress multiplied\nby dy dz, same here del tau y Y into multiplied\nby dy, alright into dx dz + del tau zx by\ndel z into dz multiplied by dx dy alright,\nsorry and this is we call equation number\n6.\nSo, we go to another page now.\nIf we divide equation 6 by volume of the element,\nwhich is equal to dx, dy, dz, right we get,\nso differential force by unit volume we call\nsmall fx, correct is equal to; it will become\ndel tau xx del x, so dx dy dz + del tau xy\ndx dy dz divided by dx dy dz, so dx dy dz\nwill get cancelled from up and below both\nso, fx can be written as simply del tau xx\nby del x + del tau xy by del y + del tau xz\nby del z and this is equation number 7, alright.\nSo, equation 7 is equivalent to taking divergence\nof vector tau xx, tau xy and tau xz that means,\nthe upper row of the stress tensor; a stress\ntensor is what; the tensor that we have should\nwritten here, alright.\nSo, this is equivalent to taking the divergence\nof these \ndivergence of vector I have written velocity\nhere, a stress tensor okay, so similarly fy\nand fz are divergence of second and third\nrow of tau ij, okay.\nThis simply means that total f surface force\nwill be summation of these forces so, in vector\nterms we can simply write tau ij divergence\nor del xj, alright, this is equation number\n8 and it is a very nice point to finish our\ncurrent lecture and then in the next lecture,\nwe can proceed from this point and go ahead\nand finalize our you know, the Navier's stokes\nequation derivation and try to cover as much\nas we can in the next lecture.\nThank you so much for listening.",
    "video_40": "Welcome back to yet another lecture of viscous\nfluid flow where we are deriving the Navier–Stokes\nequations.\nSo last time we left at this particular point\nwhere we derived that the surface force is\ndel I mean diversion of tau ij vector.\nSo proceeding forward from this point this\nit is important to note that this here \nthe diversions of tau ij is also a tensor\nokay.\nSo as a result Newton’s Law given by equation\nnumber 1 and 2 can be re-written as rho DV\nDt = rho g ij.\nNow it remains only to so there is another\nunknown term called tau ij right.\nSo now it remains only to express this tau\nij in terms of velocity V okay.\nGenerally, it is done by relating tau ij to\nstrain epsilon ij okay.\nYou remember we derived epsilon ij in terms\nof the velocity in our first lecture of this\nmodule.\nSo it is relating tau ij to epsilon ij through\nassumptions of some viscous deformation rate\nlaw which we have already done in the beginning\nall right.\nOkay so before proceeding further we will\ntake a small detour and talk about a topic\ncalled hydrostatic.\nSo hydrostatic means fluid at rest correct.\nSo we take a new page now and talk hydrostatics.\nSo from fluid definition you remember the\nbeginning definition viscous stress vanish\nif fluid is at rest correct.\nVelocity V and other shear stresses are zero\nand the normal stresses becomes equal to hydrostatic\npressure.\nSo tau xx becomes = tau yy = - pressure tau\nij = 0 for i not = j.\nSo this implies if we put in the equation\nnumber 9 that we have obtained we become delta\np = rho g all right.\nIf we assume z as upward direction that means\ndelta p will be – rho g delta z this is\nequation number 10.\nThis means pressure increases downwards \nproportional to specific weight of the fluid\nand this is a very famous equation that we\nknow from before.\nNow this was slight deviation, but we are\ngoing back again to the deformation for law\nfor Newtonian fluid okay.\nSo we are going to proceed for the further\nderivation of the Navier–Stokes Law deformation\nlaw for a Newtonian fluid.\nSo the idea was that we should be able to\nrelate viscous stress to viscous strain all\nright.\nSo the simplest \nassumption \nfor variation of viscous stress with strain\nrate is linear law given by stokes.\nHis 3 postulates are fluid is \ncontinuous and its stress tensor tau ij is\nat most a linear function of strain rates\nepsilon ij okay.\nThe second postulate is fluid is isotropic\nthat is its properties are independent of\ndirection and therefore \nthe deformation law is independent of the\nco-ordinates axes in which it is expressed.\nThird is \nwhen the strain rates are zero \nthe deformation law must reduce to the hydrostatic\npressure condition.\nTau ij = -p delta ij okay.\nHere delta ij is Kronecker delta function\nthat is delta y = 1 if I = j and delta ij\n= 0 if i is not = j all right.\nSo this was his 3 postulates that stokes said.\nSo this is the last postulate is valid for\nthe hydrostatic pressure condition all right.\nSo we proceed and say so his postulates are\nfinished.\nSo we say let x, y, z be the principle axes\nwhere the shear stresses \nand shear strain rates vanish.\nLet us assume an axes x, y and y so instead\nof x1, y1 and z1 be the principle axes where\nthe shear stress and shear strain rates vanish.\nWith these axes the deformation law could\ninvolve at most three linear coefficients\nC1, C2 and C3.\nSo example is so if you want to write tau\n11 it will be – p + c this we called equation\nnumber 11.\nHere –p is added to satisfy the hydrostatic\ncondition okay.\nNow the second postulate about the isotropic\ncondition 2 requires that cross flow effect\nof epsilon 22 and epsilon 33 be identical\nwhich implies C2 = C3.\nThis means that there are only 2 independent\nlinear coefficients in an anisotropic Newtonian.\nAll right where K = C1 – C2 we this is equation\nnumber 12.\nWe also know that epsilon 11 + epsilon 22\n+ epsilon 33 is we have seen this (()) (18:09)\nderivation of continuity equation divergence\nof V.\nSo the next step is so we have done this on\nan axes I mean this, this, this terms which\nwe this, this terms we have written we have\ndone it on principle axes where the shear\nstressor and shear strain are zero.\nSo there exist only normal stresses and normal\nstrain, but now we have to transform it into\nan arbitrary axes where all the stresses and\nstrain will exist.\nSo let us transform equation number 12 to\nsome arbitrary axes x, y, z where shear stresses\nare not zero.\nSo earlier I mean the axes the shear we have\nassumed an axes where the shear stresses and\nshear strains used to vanish, but now since\nwe have transformed into some arbitrary axes\nwhere these might not be zero okay.\nSo if we are able to do that this will give\nus a general deformation law all right.\nSo that is our next step to do.\nSo with respect to principle axes x, y, z\nlet the axes \nso with respect to x1, y1 and z1 let the current\nx axes.\nSo with respect to the previous principle\naxes x1, y1, z1 let the current x axis have\ndirection cosines l1, m1 and n1.\nLet y axes have cosines l2, m2 and n2 okay\nwith respect to the previous principle axes\nand z axes have cosines l3, m3 and n3 okay.\nWe must also remember from trigonometry l1\nsquare + m1 square + n1 square = 1 and so\non okay and this equation we called equation\nnumber 12 b all right.\nSo based on this the transformation rule between\na normal stress or strain rate in the new\nsystem which is the new system x, y and z\naxes which is arbitrary and its principal\nstresses and strain principal stresses and\nstrain are tau xx, tau yy, tau zz, epsilon\nxx, epsilon yy and epsilon zz is given by\ntau xx = tau 11 l1 square + tau 22, m1 square\n+ tau 33 n1 square and epsilon xx is given\nby same l1 square epsilon 22, l2 square, l3\nsquare okay.\nSo similarly so this one equation number 13\nrelates the principle stresses.\nSo similarly we can also relate shear stresses\nand shear strain rates \nare related to the principal stresses \nby following \ntransformation law.\nThat means tau xy can be written as tau 11\nit is related to the principle stresses l1,\nl2, tau 22, m1, m2 + tau 33, n1 n2.\nSimilarly, epsilon xy is given as epsilon\n11 l1, l2 + epsilon 22, m1 m2 + epsilon 33\nn1, n2 and this equation we call as equation\nnumber 14 all right.\nSo there are some things that you can try\nto find which I expect you to do at your home,\nbut if you have some problems we can discuss\nthat in the forum.\nSo two things try at home is use equation\n12 and 12 b to find the tau xx that we have\nwritten – p + k epsilon xx + c2 divergence\nof V try to prove that okay and secondly tau\nxy = k epsilon xy all right.\nSo this is equation number 15 and this is\nequation number 16 all right.\nSo equations 15 and 16 are desired \ngeneral deformation law okay all right.\nSo if by comparing 16 with shear flow between\nparallel plates we say k is 2 mu this we have\ndone we have seen before in our topic of laminar\nand turbulent flows so k = and there mu is\nviscosity and this is equation number 17 it\nis just by comparison.\nCoefficient C2 that we have mentioned before\nis independent of viscosity mu and is called\nas second coefficient of viscosity.\nThis is also written as lambda coefficient\nof bulk viscosity all right.\nSo equation 15 and 16 can be combined and\nwritten into a single general deformation\nlaw for Newtonian viscous fluid.\nTau ij = - p delta ij + mu delta ui del xj\n+ del uj/del xi + delta ij lambda divergence\nof V all right.\nEpsilon ij if you remember has been written\nin terms of velocity gradient.\nYou remember our lecture 1.\nSo in lecture 1 we have derived this epsilon\nij and I mean epsilon ij the shear strain\nrates and we wrote in terms of velocity gradient.\nSo I think this is the nice and appropriate\npoint to stop.\nIn the next lecture we will talk briefly about\nthe thermodynamic pressure and the mechanical\npressure Stokes hypothesis.\nAnd then we finally derive the final version\nof Navier–Stokes equation.\nSo that is enough for today and I will see\nyou in the last lecture of this module which\nwill be pretty brief one.\nThank you so much, have a nice day.",
    "video_41": "Welcome back students to the final lecture\nof this module viscous fluid flow where we\nare deriving the Navier–Stokes equations.\nSo in the last lecture we wrote the general\ndeformation law for Newtonian Viscous Fluid\nokay this equation we call it equation number\n18.\nSo proceeding forward \nso we will talk a little bit before writing\nthe Navier–Stokes equations we will talk\nabout the difference between the thermodynamic\nand mechanical pressure. So do you think they\nboth are same, no they are not. So mechanical\npressure so the pressure that we derive we\nfind out during the Navier–Stokes equations\nor any other such equation is the thermodynamic\npressure.\nSo the mechanical pressure p bar is negative\none-third of sum of three normal stresses\nall right. What are the three normal stress\ntau xx, tau yy and tau zz. So p bar can be\nwritten as – of 1/3 tau xx + tau yy + tau\nzz. or it is written lambda + 2/3 mu divergence\nof V and this is equation number 19. If you\nsubstitute the value of tau xx, tau yy and\ntau zz during the previous equation this is\nwhat you are going to get okay.\nSo what does this mean? This means that mean\npressure in deforming viscous fluid is not\n= thermodynamic property called pressure okay.\nHowever, if we want both of them to be same\ntwo different ways right. One is if you (()) (03:56)\nlook at the above equation p bar will be = p\neither lambda + 2/3 mu = 0 or divergence of\nV = 0. So let us say =0 actually this is called\nStokes Hypothesis all right. The second way\nis divergence of V can be if it is 0 then\nalso this is possible. This is possible this\nis more commonly possible because divergence\nof V 0 for incompressible flow.\nSo that is when we deal with water and hydraulics\nyou see I mean all the time we assume incompressible\nflow. So both the mechanical pressure and\nthe thermodynamic pressure they are same,\nbut in general it is not true. Now coming\nback to this Stokes Hypothesis it says even\nin case of I mean compressible fluid is lambda\n+ 2/3 mu = 0 then we can have. However, the\nexperiments indicate that it is rare.\nSo lambda is generally not = 2/3 – 2/3 mu.\nSo Stokes Hypothesis is not satisfied since\nlambda is usually and the reason is lambda\nis usually positive okay and I mean (()) (05:37)\nwe have not heard it is negative so that is\nwhy lambda + 2/3 mu = 0 this Stokes Hypothesis\nis rarely satisfied okay all right.\nSo now going back to the objective of this\nmodule the Navier–Stokes equations okay.\nSo desired momentum equation for general Newtonian\nviscous fluid is obtained by equation 18 that\nis the deformation law in rewritten Newton’s\nLaw which was equation number 9 and the result\nis famous equation of motion \ncalled as Navier–Stokes equation so it is\nrho DV Dt = rho g – delta p + del xj of\nmu vi all right.\nThis is equation number 20 and now we have\nwritten the general Navier–Stokes equations\nall right. So after we have written this Navier–Stokes\nequations it also makes a little bit sense\nto see what happens with the incompressible\nflow, how does this equation modify in case\nof incompressible flow.\nSo to do that we go to a fresh page so \nincompressible flow what is that if rho is\nthat means incompressible flow that means\ndivergence of V = 0. So if you look at the\nNavier–Stokes equations above this will\nbe 0 this the last term divergence of V all\nright. Therefore, in equation 20 if we assume\nmu is constant okay as well because in most\nof the hydraulic purposes we assume mu is\nconstant.\nThen we get Navier–Stokes equations for\nthat is \nrho g – delta p + mu del square V. This\nis another equation of significance because\nwhen it comes to Navier–Stokes equations\nfor practical purposes this is the equation\nthat we are going to use.\nSo one important thing to note is I mean we\nknow from before if rho and mu are constant\nthan the equations are totally are uncoupled\nfrom temperature correct right. I mean that\nis why rho and mu will be constant because\nif we consume constant then there is no effect\nof temperature right or if there is no effect\nof temperature we assume at a one fixed temperature\njust in case.\nBecause if you remember in the beginning we\nsaid that the thermodynamics properties I\nmean the properties are both pressure, temperature\nincluding the velocity that we need to find\nduring the conservation loss. We have not\ndiscussed about temperature because this is\nnot relevant to us so outside the scope by\nthis particular course, but if one desires\none can solve for temperature from energy\nequation alone okay, but we have not seen\nwhat that equation is.\nAnd now moving to the last part again that\nis called Inviscid flow. So actually we are\ngoing to study wave mechanics as part of Inviscid\nflow because there we will have potential\ntheory and other things, but here in Inviscid\nthe Euler it (()) (13:14) to discuss about\nmention Euler and the Bernoulli theorem how\nit has its origin okay. So if we assume that\nviscous terms are negligible as well in \nequation 21 then Navier–Stokes NS can be\nreduced to rho DV Dt = rho g – delta p.\nand \nthis is equation number 22.\nVery famously called Euler equation for Inviscid\nflow. So now you see how these equations have\ncome into existence the base going to the\norigin of these equations okay. A couple of\nsentences about this equation so this equation\nis first order right in velocity and pressure\nall right. Thus, it is simpler than another\nchange is in viscous fluid flow we have already\nbeen assuming no slip condition that you have\nseen also in the boundary layer theory and\nturbulent and laminar flows.\nSo at fixed wall no slip condition must be\ndropped and tangential velocity is allowed\nto slip because of the absence of viscous\nforces. Now the last point before we close\nour lecture is Euler equation for steady incompressible\nfrictionless flow.\nI think I will go the next paper can be integrated\nalong a streamline between points 1 and 2,\npoints 1 and 2 means any two points to give\nBernoulli's equation which is p + 1/2 rho\nV square + rho g z1 = p + 1/2 rho V square\n+ rho g z sorry at 2 okay this is equation\nnumber 23 and this is a homework question.\nPlease try to do this at home so if I enable\nwe can actually (()) (18:44) the solution\nin the forum.\nSo from the beginning of this module we have\nseen how we have went ahead and tried to from\nbasics from material derivative and the geometrical\nproperties talked about the strain rates the\nshear strain rates then we went into the equation\nof continuity using the material derivative\nthen equation of momentum we then we saw the\ndeformation laws in the fluids, we derived\nthe Navier–Stokes equation.\nWe also saw the difference between the thermal\nand the mechanical pressure and the condition\nin which both can be the same then we simplified\nour general Navier–Stokes equations which\nwe have derived that was the purpose of this\nmodule then we simplified to obtain the Euler\nequation you know and also how the Bernoulli\nequation got. So you also know the origin\nof the Bernoulli equation in its purest form.\nSo with this I would like to close down today’s\nlecture. Next week we are going to study a\ntopic that is called computational fluid dynamics\nand is a very well continuation of these equations\nthat we have read this week. So thank you\nso much for listening to me for this particular\nmodule. I will see you next week.",
    "video_42": "Welcome student to week 11 of course, hydraulic\nengineering. This week we are going to study\ntopic called introduction to computational\nfluid dynamics. This is in continuation to\nthe last week is module where we studies with\nviscous fluid flow and we derived the Navier-stokes\nequation. So, computational fluid dynamics\nis nothing more than solution of this Navier-stokes\nequation. The reverse stroke equation is quite\ncomplex.\nSo, there are different ways of solving those.\nSo, this module is dedicated to that it says\nthis is a undergraduate course we are not\ngoing to give you too many details, but at\nleast touch upon all the basic concepts of\ncomputational fluid dynamics. So, let us get\nstarted with this.\nSo, the first question that is very common\nand very obvious that you should have in mind\nis what is CFD so, the analysis of practical\nfluid flow problems involve 2 fundamental\napproaches. So, if you try to solve any practical\nfluid flow problems, we can use 2 approaches\none is experimentation and the second is the\ncalculation. So, experimentation requires\nthe constructions of model which are tested\nin various facilities.\nOne topic we have already said and read in\nthis course was dimensional analysis is very\ncritical to this experimentation because,\nwe when we do the experiments in the lab to\nbe able to apply those in real life we need\nto study dimensional analysis and the as it\nis written here experimentation involves the\nconstruction of models, which are tested in\nvarious facilities, whereas calculation involves\nsolution of differential equations.\nWhatever the differential equation of the\nproblem that we form that is the solution\nto that differential equation is called calculation.\nSo, this calculation can be performed in 2\nways one is analytically or the second is\ncomputationally analytical is mathematical\nsolution, for example, like you solve the\nintegration is an integral equation by hand\nusing the formulas of math computational is\nusing the computers.\nSo, the field of study devoted to the solution\nof the equation of fluid through the use of\ncomputers is called computational fluid dynamics\nor CFD. So this is a very crude definition,\nbut at your level we can say that the field\nof study devoted to solution of the equations\nof fluid flow through the use of computers\nis called computational fluid dynamics or\nCFD. So, the equations of fluid flow could\nbe Isler equation Bernoulli’s equation.\nSo, they are in a broad sense from the CFD\nbut in reality, the solution of Navier Stokes\nit is \ncalled \ncomputational fluid dynamics or CFD, C stands\nfor computational F stands for fluid, D stands\nfor dynamics. In this field of study called\ncomputational fluid dynamics, experimental\nresults are used, and they are often used\nand what is the purpose of using those experimental\nresults? They are used for validation of the\nCFD solution.\nSo if we get a computer based solution from\nthe equations, we use computer to solve those\nequation and we get some answers results.\nHow do we know if it is correct or not? So,\nwhat we generally do is we do the mathematical\ncalculations for the same situation as one\nof the experiments had been done before either\nwe do the experiment in the lab or somebody\nelse might have done.\nBut beforehand we know the experimental results\nof a situation for the same situation we do\nmath computer based solution and we may try\nto check if the results that we have got from\nthe computer is the same or very close to\nthe experimental results or not. So, this\nprocess is called validation means so, it\nwill validate it will justify or this will\nsay that, the CFD solution is ok or not.\nSo, if the board or the solution is successfully\nvalidated against experimental results or\na real life field study, that process is called\nthe validation of the CFD solution. So, computational\nfluid dynamics can handle laminar flows with\nvery, I mean with ease, it is not a problem\nat all the problems become complicated when\nwe have turbulent fluid flow.\nSo, the CFD solutions for turbulent flow situations\nare much more complex all right. The accuracy\nof the turbulence CFD solutions depends on\nthe appropriateness of the turbulence models.\nSo, you will be late Study in this module\nthat there are something called turbulence\nmodel just to name them one is you know k\nepsilon k omega there are different model.\nSo, these are called turbulence model.\nThere is something called which cannot be\nactually said turbulence model, but, a different\nway of solving this technique is called largely\nsimulation there is something called direct\nnumerical simulation. So, the accuracy of\nthese turbulence CFD calculation depends which\nmodule which model are we going to apply,\nwe will see that direct numerical simulation\ngives the best results most accurate results\nlargely simulations give the second best results.\nAnd the last is Reynolds averaged navier stokes\nequation in Reynolds averaged navier stokes\nequation there are different turbulence modules.\nBut everything comes with a cost. For example,\nyou must just know that direct numerical simulation\nalthough it has the best accuracy, but the\ntime of computation that is required is extremely\nhigh. So, largely simulation are the second\nbest the act in terms of accuracy, but cost\nwise it is also very high Of course, less\nthan direct numerical simulation.\nWhereas, Reynolds average navier stokes equation\nhas less than accuracy than the above 2, but\nthe time of computation is far less than what\nthese 2 type of models in CFD takes, but we\nwill come to those later as well. So, this\nis what it means the accuracy of the turbulence\nCFD solution depend upon the appropriateness\nof the turbulence model, which turbulence\nmodel is appropriate.\nNow, going to differential equations of the\nfluid flow So, the differential equations\nof fluid flow are we have been going through\nthis for a long time now, one is continuity\nequation that we have seen for example, incompressible\nflow del v = 0, which you have seen actually\nin the last week is model with lectures on\nviscous fluid flow and the second is the Navier\nstokes equation. So, these are the 2 equations\ndifferential equations of fluid flow.\nAnd the solution of these equations through\ncomputers is called CFD computational fluid\ndynamics. So, the aim of CFD is to seek the\nsolution of these equations for practical\nflow situations under consideration. You remember\nwhen we started this lecture, we defined CFD\nthe use of computers to solve the fluid flow\nequation. So, these are the fluid flow equation\nthat we are talking about continuity equation.\nAnd the Navier stokes equation and the aim\nof CFD is to seek the solution of these equations\nand it should be for a practical flow situation\nwe should not assume say a velocity of 1 lakh\nmeters per second or something like that,\nno, I mean the this the simulation should\nbe very much practical in nature like a velocity\nof 1 meters per second or a wave traveling\nwith a wave height of 1 meter if we assume\na wave height of like hundred meters, it might\nnot be very real for example.\nSo, for an incompressible flow of Newtonian\nfluid this is the continuity equation del\nv = 0 and this is continuity equation or the\nconservation equation. The second equation\nif you can remember what is this yes this\nis navier stokes equation which is actually\na transport equation and this navier stokes\nequation is for incompressible flow we want\nthis one. So, as I said navier stokes equation\ncan be classified as transport equation and\ncontinuity equation can be classified as conservation\nequation. So, this transport equation transports\nwhat it is a transport of linear momentum.\nSo, for 3 dimensional flow in Cartesian coordinates,\nthere are 4 coupled differential equations\ninvolving 4 unknowns. So if there is a flow\nwhich is occurring in 3 dimension, there are\n4 different equations, which involves 4 unknowns.\nSo one of the unknown will be the velocity\nnew direction, the other is going to be the\nvelocity in redirection and the third one\nis going to be velocity in w direction.\nAll 3 directions are velocities, and the fourth\none is going to be the pressure. These are\nthe 4 unknown as it is already written here\nu, v, w and p. And if there are 4 equations,\nI mean, there are 4 variable value variables\nu, v, w, and p. There are 4 coupled differential\nequations. So, these are the 4 equation. So,\nthis is nothing but del v = 0 as it is returned\ndel u by del x + delta v by del y del w by\ndel z.\nSo, now you would understand why I taught\nthe viscous fluid flow lecture before and\nwe derived it everything, because, this particular\nmodule CFD comprises of many visions and it\nis it will help you a lot if you can recognize\nthese equations. So, now, you can easily remember\nthat this was equation of continuity, this\n1 rho del u del t + u del u del x + v del\nu del y + w del u del z = - del p del x +\nmu del u squared by del x squared + rho g\nx. This is Momentum in x direction.\nSimilarly, and this actually we have derived\nall these equations right we wrote it in a\ngeneral form in terms of i and j but if you\nwrite it in i j and k separately there is\ngoing to be 3 equations navier stokes equations\nfor \nincompressible flow. So, this is momentum\nin the y direction and this is momentum in\nz direction.\nCFD is the technique of obtaining the solution\nof these coupled differential equations using\nnumerical methods. So, we are refining the\nC definition of CFD as we are going on initially\nwe describe we said that CFD is the computer\nsolution of the flow equations and flow equations\ncan be many right even Isler equation can\nbe the solution I mean the flow equations,\nthen we went and said CFD is the technique\nof obtaining solutions for momentum and continuity\nequation.\nAnd now, we say that these equations are copper\ndifferential equations, and we use solve it\nusing which methods numerical methods. I am\nhopeful that in you are B.tech course, you\nhave studied a course called numerical methods\nin engineering, where the different techniques\nare taught. We will go to the basics of that,\nsome of them in this module as well. CFD involve\nthe phrase replacing the partial differential\nequation that is PDE with discretized algebraic\nequation.\nThat approximates the partial differential\nequation for example, I mean will So, for\nexample, if they there is dp by dx, so, we\nhave to replace it with for example, delta\np by delta x or P2 - P1 divided by some things\nlike that this is very basic to right but\nI hope this will make it clear to you what\nis discretized algebraic equation. So, this\nis like an algebraic equation. So, CFD involves\nreplacing the partial differential equations\nwith discretize algebraic equations that approximate\nthe partial differential equation so, that\nis why there was a proximate sign when I wrote\nthose.\nNow, what is the solution procedure? The solution\nprocedure in general any CFD problems involves\nthe following steps. First is we have to define\nthe geometry of the flow, we have to discretize\nthe domain we will come to it what defining\nthe geometries what discretization of the\ndomain is and then there is a solver stage.\nAnd in the end after the solution is solved,\nthere is post processing, is after the results\nare obtained, we have to show it graphically\nor we have to find some values we have to\ninterpret those results that we got in most\nof the cases plotting the results is termed\nas post processing.\nSo, defining the geometry and the discretization\nof the domain, these 2 things are called preprocessing.\nSo, something that you have to do before the\ncalculation can begin in the computer, all\nright. And the post processing is something\nthat you have to do after the calculations\nhave something to be done with the results\nafter calculations have finished whereas preprocessing\nsteps to be completed before the calculation\ncan begin on computer. So, this is the general\ndefinition of preprocessing and post processing.\nSo now as we said that the first step is defining\nthe geometry. So, this step includes the creation\nof a CAD model what is CAD computer aided\ndesign. So, you use some software is are there\nare even tools available within the computational\nfluid dynamics models where you can define\nthe geometry or derive for example, suppose\nfor example, there is a tank right and there\nis a pier. And you have to and this is open\nno I am just drawing it in 2d assume it is\n3d and flow is coming through this right.\nSo, you will have to define this tank and\nthis so, you can do it using the CAD models\nand this is defining the geometry. So, what\ndoes this CAD model do the CAD model define\nthe shape and size of the domain in which\nthe flow equations shall be solved so, what\ndo they do the CAD model define the shape\nsay for example, as we said it was rectangular\nin shape right and the size of the domain.\nSo, what the length of the for example and\nwhat would be the water depth for example,\nhere water depth or mean your depth of the\ntank actually not the water depth I love this\none \nand also the width in 3d shape and the size\nof the domain. So, for this is a CAD model\nfor you see this resembles the wing of an\naeroplane for example. And this has been taken\nfrom fetchcfd.com this image that is why we\nhave given a reference so as alright.\nSo, the second step was discretization of\nthe domain. So, this process is known as grid\ngeneration or mesh generation. So, the process\nthis particular process of discretization\ninvolves developing a set of algebraic equations\nbased on discrete points in the flow domain\nto be used in place of partial differential\nequation we told that the way that it is to\nbe done instead of partial differential equation\nwe try to transform it into algebraic equations.\nSo, for that for example, if this is a you\nknow domain we need to know so, suppose we\nhave to divide it right that is how we are\ngoing to ride delta x and we have to divide\nit in so let us say We have divided into so\nmany different parts in x and y direction.\nSo, pardon my brain. So, the process of distribution\nwas developing a set of algebraic equation\nbased on discrete points in the flow domain.\nSo, you know, we will so, this is what meshing\nis, so, we divide our domain into so many\nsmall parts and these are helpful, because\nthen we can actually use of these points the\nif you remember if we if you remember from\nyour limits class suppose del p del x can\nbe approximated as P2 - P1 divided by x 2\n- x 1. So, this we always used to right limit\ndelta x goes to 0 right. So, this means that\nthe grid should be as small as possible for\nthis process to be done the which process\nthat converting the partial differential equation\nin into the algebraic form.\nSo for example, if there is a flow U coming\nfrom this side we have defined 1.2 point 3456787.\nSo i t i is the strength of vortex and the\nix panel i x d i, d i d x + 1. So, this is\nthe way that we do and we have taken this\nfigure from m2 and m1 is official. So defining\nthese points or forming those points using\nthe help of computer is called the mesh generation.\nSo, the most common discretization techniques\navailable for the numerical solution of partial\ndifferential equations are the finite difference\nmethod. The second is finite element method\nand another one is finite volume method. So,\nwe will go into small details of this, so\nthat you have a broader idea, you will not\nbecome expert overnight and all these techniques,\nbut will give you a very, good understanding\nand overall a holistic picture of what computational\nfluid dynamics is. So, we will touch briefly\nall of these topics.\nSo, as I said that these are these 3 are some\nof the most commonly used discretization techniques\navailable for numerical solution. So, this\nis the second step in this CFD solution first\nwas the which was the first one if you go\nback and you see, the first one was defining\nthe geometry. The second one was discretization\nof the domain and as I said, discretization\nof domain can be done using 3 different methods.\nFirst finite difference method, second is\nfinite element method and third is finite\nvolume method. So, if you see to this figure,\nthe continuous flow field is described in\nterms of discrete value that describe location.\nIn finite difference method, the flow field\nis dissected into a set of grid points. And\nthe continuous functions are approximated\nby discrete values of these functions calculated\nat grid point. So, what happens in finite\ndifference the flow field is dissected into\na set of grid points as I showed you, right\nso, this is 1 grid or these are grid points\nin x direction this is grid in y direction\nand the continuous functions are approximated\nby discrete values of these functions.\nSo, what we do we calculate the value suppose\nthe velocity and pressure we will calculate\nat this point we will calculate at this point\nusing the our conversion of partial differential\nequation to the algebraic equation. This is\nthe thing that I was trying to explain. So,\nif this is the delta x has been the mesh size\nor grid delta y. So, this is this method is\ncalled in finite difference method. If this\nis I this is i + 1 this is - 1, this is you\nknow suppose this point is I, j. So, this\nwill be this point is going to be i, j + 1,\nthis point is going to be i + 1, j + 1 now\nthis is how it is defined. So, this is I,\nj - 1, this is i + 1, j - 1.\nSo, in \nfinite element or finite volume method the\nflow field is broken into a smaller fluid\nelement called cells. Alright. So, for 2D\ndomain cells are areas all right, and for\n3d domains, these cells are volumes. So, the\ndifferential equations are written in appropriate\nform for each element and this set of resulting\nalgebraically equations are solved numerically.\nSo the differential equations are written\nfor each of these elements.\nAnd the set of resulting algebraic equations\nare solved numerically, so we write this equation\nfor each of these elements if there are thousand\nelement we write thousand equations, and we\nsolve it numerically.\nSo this is an example where you see it is\na 2d domain and therefore this is a cell.\nIn the computational domain, it is 2d. This\nis 3 dimensional come become computational\ndomain. And you see, these are like volumes\nor you can also think in a way that this 2D,\nI mean, for a same object, we have shown a\n2d representation, we can say and we have\nshown a 3d representation. It is up to you\nhow you want to take it.\nBut the main message of that needs to be conveyed\nhere is that for 2d domains, the cells are\nareas and for 3d domains, the cells are volume.\nSo, I think this is a nice point to stop this\nlecture, and we will resume in our next lecture\nfrom this point. So, thank you for listening.\nI will see you in the next class.",
    "video_43": "Welcome back students in this lecture, we\nwill we are going to continue what we started\nin the last lecture with the grid generation.\nSo, we finished that this slide. Therefore,\nwe are going to proceed from this point onwards\nand see what further analysis can be done.\nSo, we talked about grids so, there are actually\n2 types of grids. One is a structured grid\nand the structured grid means the grids are\nregular and coherent structure to the mesh\nlayer. These are the simplest the structured\ngrid and they are generally uniform rectangular\ngrid those are called the structured grids.\nSo, the structured grids look like this one\nhere. So, you see they have a uniform rectangular\ngrid. So these all the small shapes are rectangular.\nStructured grids are not limited to rectangular\ngrids only. So, these ones this could be off\nactually of any shape here it chose the rectangular\ngrids only but you see these rectangular grids\nare decreasing in size.\nThe second one are the unstructured grids.\nSo, the grid cell arrangement is irregular\nand has no symmetry pattern if you see in\nthe last one, there was a symmetry pattern\nhere. If you consider this one you see symmetry\ncause this and here it is completely symmetry\nthis one in the unstructured grids, the cell\narrangement is irregular and has no symmetric\npattern something like this, so, see the triangles,\nthese are off, no specific, same type. You\nsee this the cells here are very small, smallest\nsmaller than these ones here largest.\nSo, now after this regeneration we comes to\nthe solver stage. So, in this stage that the\ngoverning differential equations are solved\nby an approximate numerical technique after\nspecifying the boundary and the initial conditions.\nSo, the actual real solution of those differential\nequations is done at this stage called the\nsolver stage and in post processing, the extraction\nof results and visualization how the results\nappear is done. So, when it comes to extraction\nof results and visualization flow field variables\nare plotted and analyze graphically. So, this\nis the most common thing to do in the post\nprocessing.\nSo, you use you know we mentioned about boundary\nand initial conditions and that is what we\nare going to discuss next. Boundary condition\nthe same governing equations are valid for\nall compressible Newtonian fluid flow problems.\nSo, if the same equations are solved for all\ntypes of problems, and how can we achieve\ndifferent solutions for different flow situations\ninvolving different geometries that is the\nquestion because which governing equations\nare we going to talk we are talking about\nthe continuity equation, Navier stokes equation.\nSo, this is common for all the fluid flow\nproblems? Then how do we know and how do we\nachieve different solutions for different\nflow situations involving different geometries\nand this happens because of something called\nboundaries conditions.\nSo the answer is boundary conditions of the\nproblem. So, boundary conditions, I will tell\nyou what that is for example, if the flow\nis occurring in a tank itself the velocity\nis 1 meters per second, this is one continuously\noccurring. So, this is 1 boundary condition,\nthere could be other where you know the velocities\ncould be 10 meters per second for example,\nso, these are different boundary conditions\nthat is why we get different results.\nSuppose, 1 of the boundary conditions could\nbe this is closed at this end and the other\none that it could be open. So, this is another\nboundary condition so, because of this difference\nin boundary conditions we have different solutions\nof the problem.\nNow, as I said I mentioned about being closed\nand you know being open there is a wall at\nthe boundary these wall and other concepts\nyou have read in your previous lectures of\nhydraulic engineering. So, we are going to\ntalk about the wall boundary condition, since\nfluid cannot pass through a wall the normal\ncomponent of the velocity relative to the\nwall is set to 0 and this is what is this\ncalled this is called no slip condition. Therefore,\ndue to the no slip condition the tangential\ncomponent of the velocity at a stationary\nwall is set to 0.\nSo, you see there if there is an inlet here,\nthere is a wall here there is an outlet. So,\nthe velocity at this point does not matter\nwhat the velocity here is at this particular\npoint anywhere around across this wall the\nvelocity will be 0 due to \nno slip condition.\nNo not talking about the inflow and the outflow\nboundary conditions. So, you see this is inlet\nthis is outlet. So, the here from here the\ninflow will be there, and from here out flow\nwill be there. In means coming in and out\nmeans going out. So, at a velocity inlet or\noutlet the velocity of the incoming or outgoing\nflow specified along the inlet outlet phase\nat pressure inlet and outlet the total pressure\nalong the inlet and outlet phase specified.\nSo, the in the inlet and outlet can be the\nspecification can be in 2 forms, whether if\nwhether we want to specify the inlet flow\nvelocities at the inlet or outlet or the pressure.\n1 typical example here is the for the pressure\nis the pipe flow. Here it is open channel\nflow.\nSo, there is one question which I would want\nto know, solve solver discuss. So there is\na CFD code which is used to solve a 2 dimensional\nin 2 dimension X and Y incompressible laminar\nflow without free surfaces. The fluid is Newtonian.\nSo appropriate boundary conditions are used.\nSo the question here is now lists the unknowns\nin the problem and list the corresponding\nequations to be solved by the computer.\nSo first important information that we have\nis that it is 2 dimensional in nature. So,\nthe unknowns, you can start guessing the unknowns\nfirst is going to be velocity you which is\nalong X direction. Secondly, the velocity\nV, which is along Y direction. The third one\nis going to be since there is no more third\ndimension there is not going to be a W direct\nW velocity, but there definitely will be p\nthat is pressure and how are we going to solve\nthese which equations are we going to solve\nfor U V and P.\nWe are going to use 3 we see there are 3 equations.\nSo, the first equation is very common conservation\nequation which is the continuity equation.\nThe \nsecond one will be the X momentum equation\nso momentum equation in X direction. We will\nhave a Y momentum equation. So, this is very\nquiet simple to you know imagine or guess\nthat in 2 dimension only 2 dimensional velocities\nand the pressure is going to be the unknown\nand therefore, to solve we just need the three\nequations continuity, x momentum and y momentum\nequations.\nSo, now, we come to the, in the solver stage\nwe come to we have this way we have mentioned\nabout the boundary condition and now we come\nto discuss about the partial differential\nequations. So, partial differential equation\nPDE is an equation stating a relationship\nbetween a function of two or more independent\nvariables and the partial derivatives of this\nfunction with respect to the independent variable.\nSo, this is the definition of partial differential\nequation.\nSo, it states \nit states the relationship between a function\nof two or more independent variables and the\npartial derivatives of this function with\nrespect to the independent variable. For example,\nthis equation del square f by del x square\n+ del square f by del y square = 0. So, these\nare independent variables x and y and f is\nan independent variable and this equation\nis called Laplace equation from your previous\nexperience you should be knowing this another\nequation is del f by del t = alpha del f squared\nby del x square.\nSo, this is a diffusion equation the third\nequation which we have written is del square\nf by del t square = c square del square f\nby del x square and this equation is a wave\nequation. So, these are the 3 most common\ntypes of equation in partial differential\nequation that we know.\nSo, this is solution of the partial differential\nequation is that particular function f x y\nor f x, t, which satisfies the partial differential\nequation in the domain of interest domain\nis given by D x y or D x, t, f x y is when\nthe function is based only on x and y, f x\nt when if it is dependent on only x and t.\nFurther f of x, y or f of x, t. These are\n2 different type of partial differential equations\nf x, y or f x, t they also satisfy the boundary\nand our initial conditions specified at the\ndomain of interest. So, they must be satisfying\nthey must be satisfied at all places in the\ndomain or and at all times for which the calculation\nis being done.\nSo, going to take a slight detour, because\nit is important that we try to remember what\nthe classification of partial differential\nequations look like. So, they are general\nquasilinear second order non-homogeneous partial\ndifferential equation in 2 independent variables\ncan be written as Af xx + Bf xy + Cf yy +\nDf x + Ef y + F into f, this is a general\nquasilinear second order we have x x, x y\nand y y that is second order non-homogeneous\nor partial differential equation.\nSo, A, B and C may depend on x, y, f x and\nf y, D, E and F may depend on x y and f. So,\nthis is this means quasilinear. G is non-homogeneous\nterm and may depend on x and y that is why\nwe read non-homogeneous this is not equal\nto 0.\nSo, the classification depends on the sign\nof the discriminant B squared - 4AC as so,\nin this particular equation Af xx + Bf xy\n+ Cf yy + Df x + Ef y + F f = G, the solution\nwill depend on the value of B squared - 4AC.\nAnd how does it depend if B squared - 4AC\nis less than 0, then it is going to be elliptical\npartial differential equation. If B squared\n- 4AC is going to be a parabolic partial differential\nequation, if B squared - 4AC is greater than\n0 then it is going to be a hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equation. You this you can recall\nfrom your mathematics class.\nNow going to domain of dependence and range\nof influence. So, if you consider a point\nP in the solution domain, so, there is a point\nin the domain P and let the solution at P\nif we assume that the solution at that particular\npoint P is f x p, y p we assume that then\nthe domain of dependence of P is the region\nof solution domain upon which f x p, y p depends.\nSo, region of influence of P the region of\nsolution domain in which the solution of x,\ny f of x, y is influenced by the solution\nat P which is f x p, y p. So, for an elliptical\npartial differential equation the entire solution\ndomain is both the domain of dependence and\nrange of influence of every point in the solution\ndomain. So, there are 2 things domain of dependence\nof P and secondly, there is a range of influence\nof P which we have defined as the domain of\ndependence of phase the region of solution\ndomain upon which x p f of x p, y p depends\nwhereas, the range of influence of phase the\nrange of solution domain in which the solution\nof except of x, y is influenced by the solution\nat p.\nSo, applying this to an elliptic partial differential\nequation the entire solution domain is both\nthe domain of dependence and the range of\ninfluence of every point in the solution domain.\nSo, the horizontal hatching here these ones\nshows the domain of dependence whereas the\nvertical hatching the shows the range of influence.\nNow, for a parabolic PDE this is the domain\nof dependence so, horizontal hatching whereas\nthe vertical hatching like these ones \nthese are the range of influences. For a hyperbolic\npartial differential equation, the horizontal\nhatching shows the domain of dependence this\none whereas the vertical hatching shows the\nrange of influence. So, for 3 different type\nof solutions we said profiles, elliptic PDE,\nparabolic PDE and hyperbolic PDE.\nFor elliptic PDE we have seen that the domain\nof dependence is the entire solution and also\nthe domain of dependence. Whereas, the parabolic\nand hyperbolic PDE the horizontal hatching\nas shown in the figures here shows the domain\nof dependence whereas the vertical hatching\nshows the range of influence.\nNow the classification of the physical problems\ncan be classified into equilibrium problems\nor propagation problems, the third is Eigen\nproblems. So, any physical problems can be\nclassified into 3 different forms.\nWhat are the equilibrium problems are the\nsteady state problems in closed domain steady\nstate means, there is no dependence on time\nthere is an equilibrium. So, example is Laplace\nequation of such type of problems. So, here\nthe solution f of x, y is governed by an electrical\npartial differential equation subject to boundary\nconditions specified at each point on the\nboundary B of the domain.\nSo, solution of Laplace equation is governed\nby an elliptic partial differential equation\nis an important thing to remember. And of\ncourse, the solution will depend upon the\ndifferent type of boundary conditions that\nhas been specified at each point on the boundary\nB of the domain. So, we have to specify suppose\nthis is the you know, so, we have to specify\nboundary here also at all those points \nsomething like this.\nSo, if this is the figure you see you see,\nbecause this is an elliptical PDE the domain\nof independent dependence and range of influence\nare same all the domain and this is the boundary.\nSo, we should be able to supply the boundary\nconditions at all the points, which is denoted\nby B here.\nThe second type of problems or propagation\nproblems. So, an example is initial value\nproblems in open domains. So, open with respect\nto one of the independent variables example\ntime the solution f of x, t in the domain\nis marched forward from the initial stage.\nSo, we know things that time t = 0, then we\ngo from time t = 0 so let us say t = 2 seconds\nthen time t = 2 seconds and time t = 3 seconds.\nSo, the marching of the solution is guided\nand modified by the boundary conditions. So,\nif we have a different boundary conditions,\nwe still have to specify the boundary condition\nat time t = 0 initial at initial point, and\nwe will also have to specify the initial problems\nat initial values at all the points in the\ndomain. So boundary conditions and also the\nvalue at all the points in the domain initially\nto.\nExample 1 here is the diffusion equation,\nyou see this is an open boundary and we have\nto go from it is in x and this is in time\nt, this is x direction. So, this are solved\nby the parabolic partial differential equation\nparabolic PDE diffusion equation, second example\nis a wave equation. So, the wave equation\nis solved by the hyperbolic PDE hyperbolic\npartial differential equation. So, as we have\nseen 3 different type of equations have different\npartial differential equation profiles 1 was\nelliptical, Laplace equation the diffusion\nequation has parabolic partial differential\nequation and a wave is hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equations.\nNow the last one in this set is the Eigen\nproblems. So, problems where the solution\nexists only for special values of parameter\nof the problem. So, it the solution will not\nbe there for all the values of the parameters.\nSo, and these special values are called the\nEigen values hence, these problems have involved\nadditional step of determining the Eigen values\nis the solution procedure.\nSo, this is about the 4 type of problems that\nwe were talking so, now, from this point onward\nwe will proceed to the discretization technique\nthat is the in we start with the finite difference\nmethod first. There are significant benefits\nin obtaining a theoretical prediction of a\nphysical phenomenon. So, the phenomenon of\ninterest here are governed by differential\nequations concept that is replacing the continuous\ninformation contained in the exact solution\nof the differential equation with discrete\nvalues.\nThere is something called the Taylor Series\nFormulation which we generally use, usually\nfinite difference equation consists of approximating\nthe derivatives in the differential equations\nvia a truncated Taylor series. So, how do\nwe approximate the derivatives in the differential\nequation using a truncated Taylor series,\nwhich looks like this? I am pretty sure you\nhave read that in your math class.\nSo, phi 1 is written as phi 2 - delta x del\nphi by del x at 2 + half delta x whole squared\ndel squared phi into del x whole squared at\n2. So, at series like this goes on with alternate\n- and + signs. So, this is called the truncated\nTaylor series or phi 3 can be written as phi\n2 + delta x del phi del x + half del x squared\nand it can go on like this.\nSo, truncating the series just after the third\nterm adding and subtracting the 2 equations\nso, you see there were 2 equations phi 1 and\nphi 3 both were return in terms of phi 2.\nIf what we do if we just do you know if we\nfirst stopped the series just after the third\nterm and add and subtract the 2 equation then\nwe obtain del phi by del x at .2 will be phi\n3 - phi 1 by 2 delta x and also del square\nphi by del x square can be written us phi\n1 + phi 3 - 2phi 2 by delta x square.\nSo, what we have seen here, we have used the\ntruncated Taylor series in general to write\nthese values phi 1 and phi 3 and phi 2 and\nin once we add those and once we subtract\nthose we get terms like these so, the substitution\nof such expression into differential equation\nleads to finite difference equation.\nSay like this so, analytical solution of the\npartial differential equation provide us with\nclosed form expressions which depicts the\nvariation of the independent variable in the\ndomain, so, this is the domain here \nand the numerical solution based on finite\ndifferences provide us with the values at\ndiscrete points in domain which are known\nat grid points. So, the difference between\nthe analytical or the mathematical solution.\nWhat does analytical solution of the partial\ndifferential equation provide us they provide\nus with closed form expressions we depict\nthe variation of the dependent variable in\nthe entire domain. Whereas, using the numerical\nsimulation based on finite difference it provides\nus with the values at discrete points in the\ndomain. So, it will provide us the value here.\nHere, whereas mathematical solution will give\nus closed form expression which is valid everywhere\nnot only at some points.\nSo, of course, if we are able to obtain the\nanalytical solution that is the best case\nscenario, but in majority most of the cases\nactually majority of the cases we are not\nable to do that therefore, we resort to the\ntechnique of finite difference method.\nSo, I think this is a nice point to stop and\nin the next lecture we will start with elementary\nfinite difference quotients. So, thank you\nso much for listening and I will see you in\nthe next lecture.",
    "video_44": "Welcome back students, we were discussing\nabout the partial differential equations in\nthe last lecture where we have seen the elliptical\nor PDE, a parabolic and hyperbolic PDE.\nAnd we also saw in the last class they start\nthe sum of the concepts of the finite differences.\nSo, we are going to proceed forward now and\ntalk about elementary finite difference quotients.\nSo, derived from Taylor series expansion so,\nthe elementary finite difference quotients\nare real derived from the Taylor series expansions.\nSo, example is that u i j is the x component\nof velocity u i + 1 at point i + 1, j can\nbe expressed. So, u i j is the x component\nof the velocity, u i + 1, j at a point i +\n1, j can be expressed in terms of Taylor series\nexpansion about point i, j as.\nSo, u i + 1, j can be written as u i, j +\ndelta u del u del x at i, j into delta x +\ndelta squared u by del x squared at i, j multiplied\nby delta x square by 2 and so on. So, this\nis using Taylor series expansion. So, this\nactually can be truncated after finite number\nof terms \nI mean we can decide 3 terms of 4 terms of\n5 terms. So, we can actually we have decided\nto truncate it after 3 terms.\nSo, u i + 1, j can be written as u i, j +\ndel u del x multiplied by delta x del squared\nu del x square into delta x squared by 2 and\nthese are evaluated at i, j both of these\nterms. So, this equation is second order accurate\nbecause we have square term del squared u\nby del x squared.\nSo, if you want to make it first order liquidate\nit accurate it can be written as u i + 1,\nj is u i, j + del u del x evaluated at i,\nj into delta x. So, this is first in first\norder so, its first order accurate. So, it\nis now obvious that the truncation error can\nbe reduced by retaining more term in the Taylor\nseries expansion of the corresponding derivative\nand reducing the magnitude of delta x. So,\n1 important thing to note here is that there\nis a truncation error so, the full value will\nbe the exact and perfect value.\nBut we have decided to truncate some of those\nterm truncate means leave out those terms.\nSo, this error can be reduced by retaining\nfirst ways retaining more terms in the Taylor\nseries expansion the more than number of terms\nthe less will be there. And if you reduce\nthe magnitude of delta x, then also that can\nbe there because this delta x is reduced then\ndelta x x squared x cube will be even more\nand more is less, therefore, the truncation\nof those terms we do will be almost negligible.\nSo, from the above equation, you see the first\norder equation and the second order equation,\nif we write we can evaluate del u del x at\ni, j which means del u of i + 1, j - U of\ni j divided by delta x + truncation error\nwhatever we have left out. So, this is actually\ncalled the first order forward difference\nforward, because we have i + 1. So, if say\nthis is i, j and this is i + 1 and, this is\ni + 1 line and this is j line, this is j - 1\nand this is j + 1 and then that means, it\nis forward i + 1.\nSimilarly, we can also write del u del x i,\nj in the backward direction that means, u\ni, j - u i - 1, j by delta x + whatever the\ntruncation error is, and this is called the\nfirst order backward difference. So, now you\nunderstand the difference between first order\nforward and first order fine in the first\nquarter backward difference. So, in the forward\nwe have i + 1 - i and in the backward we have\ni - i - 1. So, I indicates the indices at\nthe grades of the grids.\nThere can be another way where you can actually\nyou know so, let us say this is i this is\ni - 1 this is i + 1, so, you can just do this\none that. So, first write the equation between\nthese 2 points then between these 2 points\nand subtract this is what we have done here,\nyou know, so, this actually gives the difference\nbetween u i + 1 – u i - 1 you see, and then\nit will be divided by 2 delta x because the\nlens between this is delta x and this is delta\nx, so, this total becomes 2 delta x.\nSo, this is another way and this is called\nthe second order central difference, because\nwe are calculating what are we calculating\nagain drawing this is i, j this is i + 1,\ni - 1, j this is i + 1, j. So, we are actually\ncalculating the del y by i - 1 i + 1. So,\nwe are actually calculating del y by del x\nat point i, j So, it is that there we are\ncalculating the value of dy by dx here using\nthe point bag here and here.\nThat is why it is called the send second order\ncentral difference this is central in the\nbackward you see we are calculating it i using\nthe 1 there - the 1 at the back here we are\ncalculating it i using the 1 in front - the\ncurrent 1. So we have to put time derivative\nas forward difference and space derivative\nof central difference. Called the FTCS forward\ntime central space. So what we do we have\nto put time derivative as forward difference\nor time as forward difference, because time\ncannot be in the back?\nSo we will always have to be forward and for\nthe space we use central difference that is\nthe most standard practice and this is called\nas FTCS forward time central space. So, you\nare expected to know these terminologies what\nFTCS is what is forward difference what is\nbackward difference what is central difference\nin for time derivative which is used for space\nwhich is most commonly used. So, for space\nwe said that was a central difference for\ntime which is the forward difference. So,\nterms like that are quite important.\nSo, we write u i in this is for the time,\nyou see this n so for so we ride u i n + 1\n– u i n is alpha u i + 1 and So, these i\n+ 1 and i and i - 1 are all calculated at\nthe previous time or at the current time.\nSuppose we are at let us say we are at we\nare at time t = 1 seconds we have the solutions\nwe want to calculate 40 = 2. So, velocity\nat t this is at t = 1 second, this is also\nthis here. This is also at t = 1. So, you\nsee n n n. So, these all things we know from\nthe previous time step what we need to know\nis u i at n + 1.\nSo, there is a term called consistency now,\nso what actually is consistency. So, a finite\ndifference representation of a partial differential\nequation is said to be consistent, if we can\nshow that the difference between the PDE and\nits finite difference representation vanishes\nas measures defined. So, this again in a different\nword, if this representation of I mean CVV\nsaid that we are going to represent partial\ndifferential equation in an algebraic form\ncorrect.\nSo, this algebraic form is currently finite\ndifference method we are using the method\nof finite difference to represent it into\nalgebraic form. So, this solution is consistent\nif we are able to show that the real solution\nthat is the PDE solution. The difference of\nthat with the 1 that is obtained using the\ncurrent method that is a finite difference\nmethod will go away will be 0 or it starts\nto go to 0 as we have gone delta x is refined\nas measures refined as max goes to 0. ,\nAs the measures refined this is then you remember\nwe had this limit delta x goes to 0 in your\nlimit analysis. So, limit off mesh goes to\n0, the partial differential equation - the\nfinite difference equation goes to 0, if mesh\nthe mesh size goes to 0 if we are able to\nshow that that means our solution of the partial\ndifferential equation using the finite difference\nrepresentation is consistent.\nThere is another term called convergence.\nThe solution of the algebraic equation that\napproximate a partial differential equation\nsame thing, is convergent If it approaches\nthe exact solution of the PDE for each value\nof the independent variable as grid spacing\ntends to 0. So, the solution of this if the\nsolution is turned to be convergent, if this\nsolution approaches exact solution of the\nPDE for each value of the independent variable\nas the grid spacing turns to 0, not the combination\nof different variables for each.\nAnd individual for each x and y for example,\nx and y are the independent variables are\nfor each of these x and y, this should converge\nto the real original solution of the PDE then\nthat means the solution is convergent. So,\nthe requirement is u i at n = u bar x i, y\nn as delta x delta t goes to 0, where u bar\nx i y and this dissolution of the system of\nalgebraic equations.\nNow, there is something called the error and\nthe stability analysis the numerical solution\nwhich we have obtained using the finite differences\nscheme they are influenced by 2 sources of\nerror 1 is discretization the 1 I mean the\nerrors are introduced you to 2 methods 1 of\nwhich is discretization this is the difference\nbetween the exact solution of the partial\ndifferential equation and exact solution of\nthe corresponding finite difference equation\ntruncation errors.\nSecond there is round off error. So, this\nis a numerical error introduced for a repetitive\nnumber of calculations in which the computer\nis constantly rounding the number to some\ndecimal point. Suppose the accuracy of the\ncomputer is let us say 3 decimal units. And\nif our solution is 0 point, I mean 1.117985\nor let us say assume the value of phi is 3.14\nit goes on so, when the computer is let us\nsay a third of the accurate up to third order,\nthe computer will keep on rounding the values.\nTherefore, there will be 1 error introduced\ndue to the rounding off. So, 1 due to discretization\nsecond is due to the rounding off. So, this\nare the 2 errors that we had talked about.\nNow, we can proceed to another concept in\nthe computational fluid dynamics module that\nis von Neumann stability analysis. So what\nis the stability analysis? We say if A is\nthe analytical solution of a partial difference\naccuracy and D is the exact solution from\na real computer with finite accuracy. A is\nthe analytical solution of partial difference\naccuracy and D is the exact solution from\na real computer with finite accuracy and N\nis the numerical Samuel simulation from a\nreal computer with finite accuracy.\nSo, A is analytical solution D is exact solution\nexact means perfect solution and N is the\nnumerical simulation, if we use these 3 terms.\nThen the discretization error is A - D = truncation\nerror = the error introduced you to treatment\nof boundary condition whereas the round off\nerror epsilon is N - D. Now you understand\nthese round off error and the discretization\nerror discretization error is a - d.\nSo discretization A - D. So, analysts the\ndifference of the analytical solution of the\npartial diverse difference accuracy - exact\nsolution from a real computer with finite\naccuracy, whereas, the round off error is\nN - D. So, this is von Neumann stability analysis\nand we can write N = D + E D + epsilon.\nSo, the numerical solution and N satisfy the\nfinite difference equation like this, and\nD is the exact solution of the finite difference\nequation and it exactly satisfies this one\nA and B, A was the finite difference in the\nfirst page that we saw A. You see this is\nA these the exact solution of the finite difference\nequation and it is exactly satisfies this,\nso and will satisfy both.\nSo, if you perform A - B, so, epsilon of n\n+ 1 - epsilon i of n delta t will be written.\nSo, from this equation we can see that the\nerror also satisfies the difference equation.\nFor stability the errors must shrink from\nstep n to n + 1. So, the mandatory condition\nis epsilon i of n + 1 divided by epsilon of\ni has time n must be less than 1 because it\nis supposed to decrease assume that the distribution\nof errors along the x axis is given by a Fourier\nseries in x and the time was distribution\nis exponential in t, then we can write epsilon\nx, t is e to the power at So, this is the\nequation using which it is given L is the\nunit complex number i capital i and k is the\nwave number. This is very complex.\nSince the behavior of each term of series\nis same as the series itself. Hence, let us\ndeal with just 1 term of the series and so,\nwe do see there are a lot of term in this\nseries e at is the sum e Ik mx So, we just\nyou know use only 1 term and we write E of\nm x, t e to the power at e to the power I\nk m x. And if you substitute this equation\nin the error equation, you see that error\nequation that we had got this was the error\nequation and if we substitute this.\nIn the error equation, we are going to get\nit a complex equation like this. Now, if we\ndivide this equation by e to the power a t\nto the power i k m x we are going to get on\nthe left hand side we are going to get e to\nthe power a delta t because T and T will get\ncancel = a more simplified solution e to the\npower i k m delta x because x and x + delta\nx so, this will remain delta x here also delta\nx and y this will completely go away this\nwill you know so, on dividing by e to the\npower alpha t at e to the power i k m of x.\nwe can therefore using this equation from\nhere we can write e to the power a l 40 can\nbe written as 1 + alpha 2 delta t divided\nby delta x squared. So, you see this term\nhere or we can write it in terms also of sine\nsquare by 2 term so this becomes 1 - 4 alpha\ndelta t by delta x squared sine square km\ndelta is by 2 the derivation is not in your\nscope, but we will finally look at the answer\nthe result that we are going to get therefore,\nwe can write this e to the power n + 1 see\nwe have got e to the power a delta t.\nTherefore, this error we can actually write\ne to the power alpha t + delta t into e to\nthe power i k m x divided by e to the power\na t e to the power i k m x = e to the power\na delta t.\nSo, this equation must be satisfied for stability\nmod of 1 - 4 alpha delta t by delta x squared\nsin squared k m delta x by 2 must be less\nthan 1 or in other words this equation I think\nif you can remember this equation it will\nbe quite good. So, just remember this final\nequation, not the entire derivation, but you\nshould be able to follow what has been done\nfrom the lectures, so, this means what does\nthis mean is, so see this sign squared k m\ndelta x by 2.\nYou know so, the condition can be written\nto be alpha delta t by delta x squared should\nbe less than or equal to half, because this\nwill always be less than 1. So, this is the\nfinal solution that we get for stability very\nimportant, so, you should remember this 1\nas well on this 1 as well. So, the final solution\nhere alpha delta t by delta x squared less\nthan or equal to half.\nThis gives the stability requirement for which\ndissolution of the difference will be stable\nand solution will proceed in stable manner\nif it satisfies the above relation. So, which\nrelation this relation that is the final solution.\nSo, the above mentioned analysis using Fourier\nseries is called von Neumann stability analysis.\nSo, you must be in principle knowing what\nis Von Neumann stability analysis.\nSo, using this we are actually going to you\nknow until the concepts which we have learned\nand now, we are going to solve this 1 question\nusing this now so, the question is classify\nthe steady 2 dimensional velocity potential\nequation, which is 1 - m squared phi xx +\nphi y y = 0 when m is less than 1 and secondly,\nwhen m is greater than 1 and third when m\n= 0, so, like always we are going to using.\nWhite screen for this so, solution to so,\nfirst we write down what is given to us 1\n- m squared into phi x x + phi y y = 0. So,\ntherefore, a = 1 - m squared. So, you remember\nthat we said discriminant of B squared - 4\nAC we have to calculate you remember that\npart here they are no B, but C = 1, so I will\nlet me take you to that because that is quite\nimportant thing to you know.\nSee A f x x + B f x y + C f y y + D f x +\nE f y + F f = G. So, let me just quickly just\ny here. So, you see our equation, it is write\ndown here. So it is 1 - m squared f x x instead\nof f x x we write f phi xx + there is no phi\nx y. So, 0 in 2 phi x y + C is 1 into 5 y\ny we have + there is no only a phi x so we\njust write 0 into phi x + 0 into phi + 0 into\nphi = 0 that is the so when we write down\nwhat we say A is 1 - m squared and B is 0,\nand C is 1, because only these 3 terms are\nbeing used in the discriminant.\nBecause so, you see, the classification depends\non b squared - 4 AC good the C, we have to\nclassify the study to diminish the velocity\npotential. So, I think it is would be better\nif we start doing this problem in our next\nclass, because otherwise, this is a slightly\nlong problem and needs a little bit more detail\nto solve. So I think I will end the class\ntoday here and we start with the solution\nof this question in our next lecture. Thank\nyou so much.",
    "video_45": "Welcome back students. So, in the last lecture\nwe started with a problem and then I went\nback and showed you what different values\nof A B and C are. So, solve this problem we\nwill use the whiteboard.\nSo, the best way is always to solution to\ngiven first we write what the things are given.\nSo equation given 1 - M squared phi xx + phi\nyy. So drawing the analogy from the general\nequation, w write A = 1 - M squared, second,\nB is 0 and C is 1. So the first part, we say\nwhen m is less than 1, we have to calculate\nthe value of b square – 4AC, so B is 0,\nso 0 - 4 is 1 - M squared into 1. So - 4 +\n4 m squared are 4 M squared – 4.\nWe have been given M is less than 1 implies\nM squared will also be less than 1 which implies\n4 M squared is less than 4 so if you bring\n4 on this side, it will become 4 M squared\n- 4 is less than 0. Therefore, this value\n4 M squared - 4 are B squared – 4AC will\nbe less than 0 which means it is and elliptical\nPDE so in the \nsecond part, when m is greater than 1.\nWe have found out does not matter what the\nvalue but b squared - 4 AC came out to be\n4M Squared - 4, right. So when M is greater\nthan 1, this means 4 M squared - 4 is going\nto be greater than 0, which implies B squared\n- 4 AC is greater than 0, this implies it\nis hyperbolic PDE. Now the hard part is I\nwill rub this one here B squared - 4 AC when\nM = 1. So B square - 4 AC came out to be 4\nM squared - 4 right. So when M = 1 4 M squared\n- 4 = 0. This means it is parabolic partial\ndifferential equation.\nSo, this is how we have solved the problem.\nSo I will just write the solution here. So,\nwhen M is greater than 1 it was elliptical\nPDE M greater than 1 it was hyperbolic \nAnd for M = 1 it was parabolic PDE. So, time\nto move onwards.\nWill solve another problem. So, it says that\nconsiders the function phi of x y is e to\nthe power x + e to the power y and we have\nto consider the point x, y as 1, 1 we have\nto calculate the exact values of del phi del\nx and del phi del y at this point at point\n1, 1. Secondly, use the first order of finite\ndifference with delta x = delta y = 0.1 to\ncalculate the approximate values of delta\nphi by delta x and delta phi by delta y at\n1, 1 and calculate the percentage difference\nwith the exact value. So, this is the application\nof all the things that we had done in the\nlast lecture and this will be a good way to\nunderstand.\nSo, solution number 3. So, what we have been,\nwe know that the function phi x, y has been\ngiven as e to the power x + e to the power\ny. So, for the first part, we should be able\nto calculate del phi del x will be e to the\npower x correct and del phi del y is going\nto be e to the power y simple partial differential\nso we have to calculate del phi del x at 1,\n1, it is going to be e to the power 1 are\n2.7183. Similarly, del phi by del y at 1,\n1 e to the power y that is e to the power\n1 2.7183.\nSo, that was a first question that we have\nsolved the values of del phi del x at 1, 1\ndel phi del y at 1, 1. In the second part\nwe have been given that delta x = delta y\n= 0.1 this is what we have to assume let 1,\n1 be denoted by i, j. And if we use first\norder forward difference del phi del x at\ni, j can be written as phi of i, j + 1, j\n– phi i, j divided by delta x del phi del\nx i, j can be written as phi of phi at what\n.1 because delta x is .1, so 1 + delta x so\nthat is 1.1, 1 – phi at 1, 1 divided by\n0.1.\nThis will be e to the power 1.1 + e to the\npower 1 - e to the power 1 + e to the power\n1 we just putting in the values and if you\nuse your calculator, it is going to be 2.8588.\nThat is del phi del x at 1, 1. So, we are\ngoing to it is everything here and proceed.\nSo, similarly del phi by del y i, j will be\nphi of i, j + 1 – phi of i, j divided by\ndelta y are the value of the function at 1,\n1 .1 – phi at 1, 1 divided by delta y 0.1\nare e to the power 1 + e to the power 1 +\n1 - e to the power 1 + e to the power 1 divided\nby 0.1. This is 2.8588. So, percentage difference\nfor both cases \nis 2.8588 - 2.7183 divided by 2.7183 and this\npercentage difference come out to be if this\n5.2%.\nSo, this is the answer. So, this was the simple\nmost question and the solution for demonstrating\nthe percentage difference and the concepts\nthat we have learned in the last lecture.\nSo, we proceed from this point now.\nTo we mentioned about other schemes of may\nbe machine that is the introduction to finite\nvolume method, what is finite volume method.\nSo, the finite volume is the sub domain method\nwith piecewise definition of field variable\nin the neighborhood of chosen control volume,\nso, the total solution domain in the Finite\nvolume is divided into smaller control volume.\nSo, the total solution to the total domain\nis divided into smaller control volumes. Normally\nthey are rectangular in shape or quadrilateral\ninch.\nSo, nodal points are used with these control\nvolumes for interpolating the field variable\nand usually a single node at the center of\nthe control volume is used for each control\nvolume. So, this is the 1 single point in\nthat control volume that is used and this\nis based on the cell balance equation. It\nis solved by the integral approach which is\nmore accurate than the finite difference method\nbecause it is free from truncation error.\nSo, one thing about the integral approach\nis that it is free from the truncation errors.\nCell structure is shown in this figure here,\nyou see, this is the control volume the dashed\nno zone and this at the center point you know,\nwe calculate the things simple is one method\nwhich is called semi implicit method for pressure\nlinked equations. So, simple algorithm is\nbased on finite volume method this is just\none example of finite \nthis was just something about the finite volume\nmethod.\nSo, now going to the things that are very\nmuch relevant to our hydraulic engineering\ncourse that how do we model or do the numerical\nmodeling of the turbulent flows because most\nof the flows in real nature at turbulent for\nturbulence is a 3 dimensional unsteady phenomenon.\nSo, it is a function of time and it also function\nof a space. So, a huge amount of information\nis needed for the proper description of the\nturbulent flows that is a very well established\nfact.\nHence, an ideal turbulence method must be\nable to capture the features of the turbulent\nflow field at a minimum complexity level.\nSo, ideally the best of the numerical model\nthat can do this type of turbulent flow modeling\nshould be able to capture the features of\nthe turbulent flow with least complexity level.\nSo, the model should be least complex as well.\nTurbulent flows can be modern numerically\nto capture the temporal fluctuations the time\naverage features of the flow field. So, in\nthe real velocity you know i mean the fluctuations\nmean the deviation from the average velocity\nand the time average features of the flow\nfield. So, these because these 2 effect the\nturbulence in terms of turbulent stresses\nthese 2 quantities, you remember we mentioned\nabout you prime and you bar in our laminar\nand turbulent force flows.\nSo, average flow properties in the turbulent\nfluctuations are actually coupled \nand why are the coupled due to nonlinear nature\nof the turbulence, this is all the information\nthat we know from before. And for this particular\nreason, we cannot ignore the fluctuations\nunder any circumstances. So, an ideal turbulent\nmodel should be able to capture all these\nfluctuations too.\nThis turbulent flow is comprised of vortices\nwith a range of different sizes. Simulations\nof all scales of the vortices is not possible,\nI mean, the vortices could be very, small\nas well. So, the modeling of the smallest\nof these vortices might not be possible, because\nthe reason is we have limitations on the available\ncomputational facilities. The time and the\nquantum computing is the reality this might\nbe an easier thing to do.\nBut for now, until that point, we still consider\nthat our computational facilities where we\nare able to capture all the scales of what\nit says is not yet possible. Further a universal\nturbulence model which is valid for all the\nturbulence flows is not yet available as well.\nSo, with this background, we come to one of\nthe most important techniques to solve these\nnavier stokes equation and this is called\nReynolds average navier stokes equation as\nthe name indicates, what we do is, we do the\naveraging of the Navier stokes equation Reynolds\nbecause Reynolds was the first scientist to\ndo it. So, we have already discussed this\nterm called Reynolds decomposition we have\ndiscuss this and laminar and turbulent flow\nmodule and the Reynolds condition. If you\nare able to recall just in just in a case\nwhere you are not I have included that again\nas a quick repetition.\nSo, what is Reynolds decomposition for the\ninstantaneous velocity is u v w and the pressure\np u can be written as u bar + u prime. And\nv is written as v bar + v prime this is the\nbar whatever is in the bar denotes the average\nvalue and whatever is with the prime it indicates\nthe fluctuations. Similarly, w is written\nas w bar + w crime and pressure is written\nas p bar + p prime.\nSo, if we say that f dash and d dash or any\nto general fluctuating parameters, we also\nhave dealt this in our previous slide, then\nthe average of f bar and g bar is going to\nbe 0 so, f prime whole bar and g prime whole\nbar is 0. Also we know that f prime multiplied\nby g prime and taking the average of that\nquantity is not equal to 0. If you recall\nwe had Renault shear stress in u prime w prime.\nIf this was 0 then there would be no shear\nstress but this is not equal to 0 there is\na finite shear stress.\nThe third is the del f prime. So, the del\ns of the fluctuation the first differential\nand also the second differential and if we\ntake the whole bar = 0 also if we multiply\nboth the fluctuations f dash the dash take\nthe differential and average it will not be\nequal to 0. So these are called the Reynolds\ncondition. So, this we have already seen before.\nSo, for a velocity field ui we can write ui\nprime into uj bar to the whole bar = 0. Also\nui double bar = ui bar. If you take the average\nof the average it is the average itself and\nthe fluctuation if it is average it is 0,\nthis is Reynolds averaging.\nSo the continuity equation for the incompressible\nflow is this Del uk by del x k = 0, right.\nAnd if we do the we perform the Reynolds averaging\non the above equation, it is going to yield\none equation that is del uk bar by del x k\nbar = 0, right? You do not have just uk you\ncan write uk bar + uk Prime. And so Del, uk\nby del x k will be del uk bar by del x k +\ndel x k uk bar and this will go to 0 So, this\nwill can be represented as this.\nThe Navier stokes equation for incompressible\nflow can be written as Del ui Del t + Del\nui uj by Del x j = - 1 by rho Del p del xi\n+ del xx j to nu Dij this is a standard form\nof. So, dij here is a strain rate tensor which\nwe have seen in the last lecture in our viscous\nfluid flow that dij returns half of Del ui\nby Del x j + Del uj by Del xi. I think this\nis not a problem because we have derived it.\nSo, if we do the averaging of navier stokes\nequation, if we put u = u bar + u prime and\ntake the whole average of the equation so,\nu = u bar + u prime and v = v bar + v prime\nand w = w bar + w prime and p = p bar + p\nprime and put it into Reynolds equation and\ndo the whole average of the equation. We are\ngoing to get equation like del ui by del t\nwhole bar, del ui bar del uj bar So, if you\nsee this is average term, this is also average\nterm and this is also average term right.\nSo, if we use equation to the above equation,\nyou see you remember that equation to this\none here Del uk bar by del x k = 0 using the\ncontinuity equation it can be written as Del\nui bar by delta t = - 1 by rho del p bar by\ndel xi + del x j of - tau i j + 2 nu dij.\nAs if this is equation number 5. So, this\nactually is nothing but Reynolds average Navier\nstokes equation. There is some things that\nwe need to find out what is tau ij dij we\nalready know.\nSo, in the above equation tau ij is ui prime\nmultiplied by uj prime this is generally called\nReynolds shear stress and as we have read\nabout it, is much more than the kinematic\nstress and tau ij here is a symmetric tensor\nsymmetric means, ui prime uj prime = uj prime\nui prime. So, the term rho into when rho multiplied\nby tau ij is known as turbulence stress or\nReynolds stress. The objective is to solve\nthe Reynolds average continuity and momentum\nequation to obtain the average flow feel ui\nbar and rho.\nSo the objective of this thing is to solve\nthe flow for ui bar and p bar we want to find\nout the average quantities that is so that\nis why we do some turbulence modeling.\nSo how do we do it we solve the Reynolds stress\nequation if we subtract equation to the beginning\nequation, second equation from equation 1\nwe can get Del uk prime divided by del xk\n= 0. Similarly, if you subtract equation 4\nfrom equation 3 you see question number 4,\nthis 1 is 4 and this 1 is 3. So, what we are\ndoing is we are subtracting the average to\na general equation in both the cases.\nWe are going to get Del ui prime del t + uj\nprime original equation - averaged equation\nsame is here original equation - average equation\nand why do we do this to obtain fluctuation\nequations. So, with that this is how we are\nwe obtain the equations with fluctuation terms\nin terms of differential equations.\nIf expressing uj bar into Del ui bar Del u\nuj prime into del ui prime del t + ui in terms\nof equation 7. So, if we express that in terms\nof equation 7 here, you know and this is called\nthe Reynolds stress equation where this dij\nis called the production of Reynolds stress,\nthis pi ij is the pressure strain correlation\ntensor and epsilon ij is a dissipation where\nj ijk is diffusive flux you can try to do\nthis at your own, but the derivation of this\nis outside the scope of the current course,\nI have shown you the methods how to get 1\nequation from the other but the details is\nnot in your course curriculum.\nAnd this is Reynolds stress equation, equation\nnumber Pij is given as - tau ik del uj by\ndel xk - tau jk del ui del xk this is the\nexpression of the dissipation production and\npressure strain correlation factor epsilon\nij is the dissipation it is expressed like\nthis to nu del ui prime del xk del uj prime\ndel xk whole bar.\nWhere Jik is given in this for this is velocity\nfluctuation, this is pressure fluctuation\nand this is fluctuation due to the viscosity.\nTherefore, JT ijk can also be written as ui\nprime uj prime and uk Prime are you see, this\nvelocity fluctuations is written like this\nthe pressure fluctuation is written like this\nand viscosity fluctuations is written like\nthis. So, we have seen what all these terms\nof we have seen that all what all these term\nmeans, for this Reynolds stress equation.\nYou see this one here, Pij pi ij a production\nof Reynolds stress dissipation diffusive flux\nand pressure strain correlation factor. So,\nyou do not need to remember all the details\nhere, but the way of doing it is quite an\nimportant and somebody who would be interested\nin doing further research or further studies\nin M.Tech this will be a complete course in\nitself. So, now, how to close this problem\nis the important question and that will be\nthe topic of our next lecture.\nAnd we will also proceed with techniques like\ndirect numerical simulation and large at simulation\nfor the modeling of computational fluid dynamics.\nSo, this will be all for today. Thank you\nso much for listening and I will see you in\nthe next lecture.",
    "video_46": "Welcome students to the last module of hydraulic\nengineering course, in this module we are\ngoing to study in inviscid flow, the typical\napplication that is wave mechanics, we are\ngoing to study linear wave theory, the derivation\nof velocity potential from scratch, we will\nalso look at the boundary value problems and\nso, do you know to get started with that,\nwe will first see what the linear wave theory\nis let us start with that.\nSo, linear wave theory, what is that as the\nname indicates, the linear wave theory can\nbe guessed as you know when the waves are\nconsidered linear in nature. So, the background\nis as everybody knows that the real water\nwaves have you seen waves in the ocean. So,\nthe disturbances that traveling in the ocean\nare actually waves they might not be linear\nbut they are waves. So, the real water waves\nthey propagate in viscous fluid. So, the way\nthe fluid in which it propagates is viscous\nlike water mostly propagates in water.\nSo, and you know water is a viscous fluid\nand it propagates over an irregular bottom\nof varying permeability so, that is a real\ncase scenario. However, we assume that the\nmain body of the fluid is a rotational because\nthe viscous effects but we have learned in\nthe; our laminar and turbulent and viscous\nfluid flow classes is that the viscosity with\nthe viscosity effects are limited near to\nthe bottom. So, the bottom above that bottom\npart, the main body of the fluid is in rotational.\nAnd what is the reason because, as I said\nviscous effects usually concentrate in thin\nboundary layers near the surface and also\nthe bottom because the boundary layer will\nalso be there at the surface. Since water\ncan also be considered reasonably incompressible\nwe can assume the existence of a velocity\npotential and stream function. so, going back\nto the basics you remember if we can say that\nwater is incompressible then there will exist\na velocity potential and stream function for\nan invested in irrotational flow case a recall\nyour lectures from viscous fluid flow.\nSo, to before we go ahead and start learning\nabout linear wave theory there is a very important\nconcept that is called boundary value problems.\nThis is not only important for this particular\nchapter, but any problem that has something\nto do with boundary values for example, we\nsaw in the last week lectures and CFT that\nboundary values are some of the things that\nmust be specified for the computation to start.\nSo, we look in this part more closely at these\nboundary value problems.\nSo, the formulation of boundary value problem\nis simply the expression of a physical solution\nin a mathematical forms such that a unique\nsolution exists. So, what happens is if there\nis an equation that is valid for entire domain\nentire area. And then there could be infinite\nnumber of solutions to that problem? For example,\nlet us say there is y squared + x squared\n= + z squared = let us say 9.\nSo very simple to assume one of the solutions\ncould be x = 0, y = 0 and z = 3 this is one\nsolution. The other solution could be x = 3,\ny = 0 and z = 0 the another solution could\nbe x = 0, x = 0, y = 3 z = 0 and similarly\nthere could be many other combinations as\nI written down in form of the you know, integers,\nx, y z are integers, but there could be many\nsolutions. But, boundary value problems the\nformulation of a boundary value problem is\nimportant. So, that there will exist only\na unique solution per 1 particular value of\nboundary.\nthis equation will have 1 unique solution\nthere cannot be any solution let us say, if\nwe specify for x square y square + that z\nsquared = 9 and sort of a boundary value we\nsay just you know x, if we are given that\ny is you know 3, then it will have only even\nunique solution in terms of real number x\n= 0 and z = 0. I mean this we cannot exactly\nso, this is a boundary condition but trying\nto give an analogy that because of this boundary\nvalue there will exist a unique solution for\na mathematical formulation otherwise there\ncould be in finite number of solutions.\nNow, what are the steps to formulate the boundary\nvalue problems? First is we have to establish\na region of interest? So, where are we going\nto apply that boundary very prominent we have\nto determine for example, a region of interest\nwould be a wave tank or tank where the water\nflows? Secondly, we have to specify a differential\nequation that must be satisfied within the\nregion.\nThirdly, we have to select 1 or more solutions\nout of infinite number of solutions which\nare relevant to the physical problem under\ninvestigation. So, if there is an equation\nhere if we specified a differential equation\nin the domain then the solution that have\ndifferent of that differential equation could\nbe infinite there could be many solutions,,\nbut we have to select only one or more solutions\nto the physical problem under investigation\nand this is done using the boundary condition.\nThis is exactly what I told you a couple of\nminutes ago. So, we have to reject those solutions\nthat are incompatible with these conditions.\nSo, this actually is called the implementation\nof boundary condition. So, these steps repeat\nto repeat again is the first step is we have\nto specify a region of interest. Secondly,\nwe write down the mathematical equation or\na differential equation that must be satisfied\nin the entire region domain.\nAnd third one is that we have to select only\n1 or you know more solutions let us say 1\n2 or 3 solutions out of infinite number of\nsolutions that are relevant to the physical\nproblem the real problem and this is done\nby using boundary condition very simple example\nis let us say a river for example, river or\nocean or wherever and what we say a part of\nriver or ocean, the channel. So, this is something\nlike this, where the flow is coming like this,\nwe know for sure, as we already read in our\nCFD class.\nThat continuity equation and navier stokes\nequation written by NS equation is; are to\nsuch differential equation that must be valid\nin this domain. Now, this will have in finite\nnumber of solutions. So, we must provide a\nboundary condition a boundary condition like\nthat the water entering here as a velocity\nlet us say 3 meters per second here there\nis a wall, you know, this is open boundary,\nwe can either specify a top 3 surface or even\na wall here.\nSo, what I mean to say these are the boundary\ncondition that will determine that there will\nexist a unique solution. Now, in addition\nto the spatial boundary condition as I said\nso, this is let us say inlet, outlet wall\nfor example. So, these are the; you know some\nhere velocity is given like 10 meters per\nsecond or something. So, apart from this these\nare called the spatial boundary conditions\nor geometrical boundary condition, but there\nwill also be a temporal boundary condition.\nSo, boundary condition in time that boundary\ncondition in time is called initial condition.\nSo, initial condition is nothing but a boundary\ncondition in time. So, for example, we say\nat time t = 0, the entire fluid was at rest.\nSo, this means that v = 0 at t = 0 becomes\nour initial condition and this should also\nbe specified.\nNow, under the assumption of irrotational\nmotion and in compressible fluid as learned\nin our viscous fluid flow class and the basics\nof fluid mechanics kinematics that there will\nexist a velocity potential which should satisfy\nthe continuity equation. So, what are the\nassumption irrotational motion and incompressible\nfluid there exists the velocity potential\nphi from our basic fluid mechanics classes\nthat means del dot u = 0 let us call this\nequation 1.a or we know that if there exists\na velocity potential phi, then U can be written\nas del phi.\nSo putting this here we will get Del dot Del\nphi and this is nothing but Del squared phi\nwhich means del squared phi by del x squared\n+ del squared phi by del y squared + del squared\nphi by del z squared the call this equation\nnumber 2. So, if you follow we have got del\nsquared phi = 0.\nSo, if we consider the flows which are non-divergent\nand irrotational. So, the previous equation\nwas nothing but Laplace equation so, for a\nnon-divergent and a rotational Laplace equation\nalso applies to the stream function. So, we\nhave seen for the velocity potential Laplace\nequation which is del squared phi = 0 is Laplace\nequation holds good. But, so, for the flows\nthat are non-divergent and irrotational, we\nsay that Laplace equation can also be applied\nto stream function.\nHow we are going to see, we know that for\nirrotational flow we have Del w by Del x if\nwe consider of flow in u, so, x and z direction\nthere are 2 directions that we assume there\nis no flow in y direction. So, the stream\nfunction as it you know can exist only in\n2d can be written as Del w by Del x – Del\nu by Del z because the flows are rotational.\nNow, using the definition of a string function\nif u is - del phi del z and w is del phi del\nx and if we put this so we say del w by del\nx - del u by del z = 0 instead of w if we\nput here.\nSo it becomes Del del phi Del x of - u is\nhere, so it becomes Del u Del z by Del z = 0\nso it becomes so this is with - phi. So, it\nbecomes del squared phi by del x squared +\ndel Squared phi del z squared = 0 and this\nis what in 2d plane this is all again Laplace\nequation. So repeating that so, this gives\nus Laplace equation into 2d which given by\nequation number 3 b.\nNow, the above equation as I said if you remember\nthe boundary condition analysis, we said that\nthe differential equation that we have formed\nshould be valid in the entire domain of the\nfluid. So, in the current analysis, what are\nthe 2 equations what are the equations that\nwe have devised that holds true in the fluid\nusing continuity equation, we have said that\nthis equation Laplace equation above equation\nthat is Laplace equation must hold throughout\nthe fluid. So, at this point I have a small\nquestion to you think about it what if the\nflow was frictionless.\nBut rotational not a irrotational what could\nbe the what could the equation 3 be look like.\nSo, what could be the; this equation if you\nbrush up your mind for irrotational flow this\nterm was 0. But if it is rotational then it\nis given by vorticity w so, Del squared phi\nis written as omega which = the vorticity.\nSo, this will be \nthe resulting form of equation now for irrotational\nflow regards 0 and this is true for rotational\nflow.\nNow we know that the velocity potential can\nbe defined for 2d and 3d, 2d means 2 dimension\nand 3d 3 dimension where as the definition\nof the stream function is such that it only\ncan be defined for 2d and 3d if and only if\nthe flow is symmetric about x axis. So we\nknow velocity potential is valid for both\n2 dimensions and 3 dimensions. However, the\nstring function is valid only in 2 dimension.\nOur special case in which we can still write\nit in 3d is when the flow is symmetric.\nLet us say there is a flow in x and y plane,\nthis is x, this is y and this is z., so it\nis happening, but say this is so large that\nthe variation in y direction is not there.\nSo, actually the flow is symmetric. Therefore,\nmathematically it will again be called as\n2d because the flow is symmetric about an\naxis and therefore, we can still stream function\nfor such type of flows. The second thing to\nnote is that Laplace equation is linear, that\nis it involves no products and thus has a\nvaluable property of superposition.\nSo, we do not have terms like delta x delta\ny or phi 1 in you know, does not is not there.\nSo, we try we in a different sense we say\nthat Laplace equation is linear because it\ndoes not have any product. Therefor we can\napply value the; you know the property of\nsuperposition to Laplace equations. So, what\nis that the superposition if we say phi 1\nand phi 2 are the velocity potentials and\neach of them satisfy Laplace equation, then\nwe can define another velocity potential phi\n3.\nWhich are a combination of phi 1 and phi 2\nthat is A phi 1 + B phi 2 can will also satisfy\nthe Laplace equation. So, any combination\nof phi 1 and phi 2 will satisfy Laplace equation\na phi 1 and phi 2 each satisfy Laplace equation.\nThe reason is that Laplace equation is linear\nand it does not involve any products and therefore\ncan be super imposed.\nSo, one important property is kinematic we\nare talking about boundary conditions. So,\none of the important properties called kinematic\nboundary conditions, what is our KBC at any\nboundary whether fixed or free, certain physical\nconditions must be satisfied for fluid velocities.\nAnd these conditions on water particle kinematics\nare called dynamited boundary condition. At\nany surface or fluid interface, these for\nexample, this is one of the example at any\nsurface or fluid interface there must be no\nflow across the interface for example, if\nthere is no ground here.\nThe boundary kinetic conditions will be the\nvelocity W is going to be 0 in the downward\ndirection or if there is a water surface here\nalso the water will not have any velocity\notherwise, if it has a velocity then it will\nstill be water there then there is not going\nto be an interface. So, at any surface or\nfluid interface, there must be no flow across\nthe interface and that is very, standard universal\ntype of dynamic boundary condition.\nSo, this is quite obvious actually in case\nof impermeable fixed surface like sea wall\nmathematical expression of dynamic boundary\ncondition may be derived from the equation,\nwhich describes the surface that constitutes\nthe boundary. So, now, we talked what the\ncurrent dynamic boundary condition is now,\nwe have to find what the mathematical equation\nfor such boundary conditions are and as said,\nthese kinematic boundary conditions can be\nderived from were derived from the equation\nof the surface that constitutes the boundary.\nSo, if we define a surface, we can determine\nthe dynamic boundary condition we will understand\nthis with an example.\nHow? So we say that any moving or fixed surface,\nlet us see if it is retained by so this is\nthe equation of the surface F how it is dependent\non x y z and t, we do not know, but let us\nsay there is a function f x y z, t = 0. So\nlet us take a real life example of sphere.\nA sphere let us say as a radius a So F of\nx y z, t can be written as x squared + y squared\n+ x squared - a squared = 0. Let us say this\nis the surface of the sphere.\nSo for such surface to represent an interface,\nthe total derivative or material derivative\nof the surface would be 0 on that surface.\nThis is what our definition is that there\nshould be no flow across the interface, which\nmeans that the total derivative or material\nderivative of the surface would be 0 on the\nsurface because there is no flow across that.\nSo, what we do is capital DF dt material derivative\ncan be written as Del F del t + u del F del\nx + v del F del y + w del F del z let me use\na laser pointer.\nSo, del F del t will be = DF dt whole DF dt\nwill be = del F del t + u del F del x + v\ndel F del y + w del F del z and what does\nthis say the total derivative at the surface\nso on F = 0 which means surface should be\n0 here or \nin other words we can say because this is\n0. So, if we bring it on this side, we can\nwrite – Del F del t = u dot Del F a representation\nin a vector form. So, this is an important\nequation.\nNow if we define a unit vector normal to the\nsurface so unit vector normal to the surface\ncan be written as,. So, normally if you recall\nyour mathematics class this is a unit vector\nwhich is normal to the surface using this\nand we can write equation 5 b this thing as\n- delta F del F del t = u dot simply what\nwe did instead of delta F I will just so,\nif you use this equation we just substituted\nn mod delta F we substituted this in equation\n5 b and we get this value.\nOr we can write, if we want to write u dot\nn will be nothing but if we just we what we\ndo is we just bring this being the denominator.\nSo, we get an equation u dot n = - Del F del\nt by mod of delta F on F x y z t = 0 u is\na vector and n is a normal vector.\nSo, here delta F is nothing but simple delta\nF by delta x whole squared + delta F by delta\ny wholes squared + delta F delta z whole squared.\nNow, if you look at the condition here u dot\nn = - del F del t by mod of F, this condition\nrequires that u dot n that is the fluid velocity\nnormal to the surface this is u dot n correct\nshould be related to the local velocity of\nthe surface del F del t is the local velocity\nof the surface \nby this equation.\nthe one that we wrote before let us say if\nthe surfers do not move, that means that a\nfixed, with respect to time that is the local\nvelocity of the surface is 0 that means, u\ndot n was - del F del t by mod of F if it\ndoes not move then this is 0 which means u\ndot n = 0 or in other words the velocity component\nwhich is normal to the surface is 0. And we\nhave seen this that when we assume a fixed\nsurface like the riverbed or the seabed this\nyou remember I drew a diagram and said the\nvelocity here will be 0. We just used to say\nthat but now we have proved this. That the\nvelocity component normal to the surface will\nbe 0.\nNow, we start with the bottom boundary condition.\nI think this is a Fine place to start. In\nour next lecture. We will start with this\ntopic called the bottom boundary condition.\nUntil that time. Thank you so much. I will\nsee you in the next lecture.",
    "video_47": "Welcome back students. In the last lecture\nwe studied the boundary conditions in general\nand we saw what the kinematic boundary condition\nmeans we derived an equation of the general\nsurface and the kinetic boundary condition\nrelated to that surface. In this lecture,\nwe proceed forward with the bottom boundary\nconditions also called as, BBC.\nSo, let us say the bottom is described as\nz = - h of x. So, if there is you know this\nis the riverbed or the seabed and this can\nbe z here. So, if this is x and this is z.\nSo, this depth z = - h f x because, we are\nconsidering the 0 at the free surface if we\nconsider 0 at the free surface. So, here origin\nis located at still water level that is the\nsurface of the water. So, again trying this\nis the origin let us say this is this.\nSince from the boundary condition we see the\nbottom is fixed for you dot n is going to\nbe 0, which we have seen in the previous lecture.\nSo, we can ride the surface equation as so\nthe equation was z = - h of x. So, we can\nwrite 0 + h of x 1 0 and we call it as f function\nof x and z all. And u dot n = 0 if we assume\nu is a combination of small ui + w k so, this\nis the \ngeneral you that we can assume in 2 dimension\nx and z.\nSo, we have we are going to apply what we\nhave learned in the previous lecture. So,\ndelta F is going to be delta F delta x + delta\nF delta z this is an i direction this is in\nk direction. And instead of this f we put\nz + x h. So, what we get is delta Del x of\nz + h x here icap + Del z + h x at k cap.\nSo, delta f will be del icap + k cap. This\nwill be delta F. So n will be delta F divided\nby modulus of delta x so we will get dh dx\ni cap + k divided by 1 + dh dx whole squared\nsimple mathematics. So and u dot n u is substitute\nu i cap + w k cap and n we already know this\nwas n. So if we do dot product of u dot n\nwhat do what we get we get this multiplied\nby this multiplied by this. So, we get u dh\ndx + w is equal because here whatever is there\n1 + the delta h delta x whole squared = 0.\nTherefore, if it goes this side we get u dh\ndx + w = 0 this is u velocity and this is\nw velocity, u velocity means x direction w\nmeans z direction so, we get u dot n = u dh\ndx + w = 0 on the surface or we can simply\nif we use this equation, we write w = - u\ndh dx on the bottom boundary. Now, earlier\nwe had assumed that the bottom I mean z will\nbe - h of x, all. But if you assume a case\nof horizontal bottom in horizontal bottom,\nwe know that the height will not vary as a\nfunction of x.\nSo, dh dx is going to be 0 for horizontal\nbottom, which we have written here. Therefore\nthis means w = 0. So, we have now proved that\nthe boundary w = 0 using the bottom boundary\ncondition and we have derived everything from\nthe basics of the boundary condition.\nNow, if we have a sloping bottom, we can simply\nin case of a sloping bottom like this, we\ncan write w by u = - dh dx very simple. The\nquestion to you is, could we treat this bottom\nas a streamline or not? Yes, since the flow\nis everywhere tangential to it. So this bottom\ncan be treated as a streamline because w = 0\nand therefore, the flow is everywhere tangential\nto it to the bottom boundary condition, which\nwas equation number seven also applies to\nflows in 3D in which h is h of x, y. You remember\nwe started derivation with z = - h of x.\nBut let us say z is not only a function of\nh of but it is also a function of x and y.\nThen also that bottom boundary condition equation\nseven will apply. Just it will have 1 more\nterm Indeed, differential equation that we\nhave.\nSo, another term is kinematic free surface\nsee, first we studied the boundary condition,\nwe studied kinetic boundary condition in detail.\nSo, the first sub part of that was we saw\nthe bottom boundary condition where the boundary\nwas fixed, where we utilize u dot n = 0. Now,\nthere is something called dynamic free surface\nboundary condition, free surface means, free\nsurface of water is written as. So, you the\nsurface is free it can distort if you recall\nfrom our open channel flow lectures.\nSo, if the surface is something like this,\nyou know then the free surface and this is\nit as a function of x y and t, then we can\nwrite F of x y z, t = z – eta x y t. So,\nhere eta x y t is the displacement of free\nsurface about horizontal planes z = 0 this\nis z = 0.\nSo delta F, so, we are going to apply the\nsame conditions the kinematic boundary conditions,\nso, we start calculating delta F because we\nalready have an equation F here. So, first\nstep is always calculating delta F. So, delta\nF is going to be delta F delta x i cap + delta\nF delta y Jacob + delta F delta z k cap, so,\nif we put F as here z - eta x y t, then we\nget – del eta del x – del eta del y +\nk cap, so, - del eta del x i cap – del eta\ndel y j cap + k cap. So, because then it will\nbe 1.k cap because we had the term z here,\nyou see alone term z.\nAnd delta F is going to be if you take the\nmodel as it will be 1 + delta x delta said\nmodulus is taken from here, you know this\nterm delta x delta eta by delta x whole squared\n+ delta eta by delta y whole squared and the\nunit normal vector will be delta F by modulus\nof delta. If we assume these velocities 3\ndimensional ui vj and wk then u dot n is going\nto be - u del eta del x - v del eta del y\n+ w. So, u is ui + vj + wk and eta is - del\nn cap is del eta del x i cap – del eta del\ny j cap + k cap.\nIf you do u dot n 1 = 0. So, if you see i\nwould i n i will become - u del eta del x\n+ - of v del eta del y + w or divided by of\ncourse, the denominator, 1 + del eta del x\nwhole squared del eta del y whole squared.\nSo, u dot n is going to be - u del eta del\nx - v del eta del y + w divided by the denominator\nsame as this 1 here. So, this is what we get\nu dot n.\nNow, if you use equation 6 was this. So, this\nis u dot n and if we do del F del t it will\nbe del eta del t divided by modulus of F this\nand this will get cancelled out. So, we will\nget w = del eta del t + u del eta del x +\nv del eta del y at z = eta of y x t that is\nat the free surface this is the equation of\nthe free surface this is an important equation.\nSo, this is the dynamic free surface boundary\ncondition.\nSo there is another boundary condition called\ndynamic free surface boundary condition. So\nboundary condition for fixed surfaces are\neasy to prescribe as they are applied to the\nknown surface. However the displacement of\nthe upper boundary in free surface problem\nis not known, we do not know from before how\nmuch that the free surface will go above because\nI mean the bottom is fine because it is fixed,\nbut the displacement of the free surface is\nnot known from before.\nSo, that is one of the problem in the wave\nproblem in waterway problem. Second thing\nis that the fixed surface are able to support\npressure variations across the interface whereas,\nfree surface cannot support the pressure variations\nit will distort.\nTherefore another boundary conditions is required\nfor any free surface or interface to prescribe\nthe pressure distribution and the boundary.\nSince the free surface cannot support the\npressure variation, we need to prescribe another\nboundary condition to tell what the pressure\ndistribution on that particular boundary is\nand this is called the dynamic boundary condition.\nSo, you see, we started from the boundary\nconditions, we went to the dynamic boundary\ncondition where we saw the bottom boundary\ncondition and kind emetic free surface boundary\ncondition.\nBut 1 typical thing with 3 surfaces are they\ncannot support pressure variations across\nit, unlike the fixed surface, therefore another\nboundary condition or bottom bound another\nboundary condition is required that is called\nthe dynamic boundary condition. Dynamic free\nsurface boundary condition requires that the\nrequirement of the dynamic 3 surface boundary\ncondition is that pressure on the free surface\nbe uniform along the way form.\nSo, along that free surface distortion or\nwave as we call it, the requirement is that\nthe pressure on the free surface should be\nuniform along the way form. And here to derive\nthat we use unsteady Bernoulli’s equation\non the free surface. So, we have seen the\nBernoulli’s equation for this we are going\nto use unsteady Bernoulli’s equation unsteady\nmeans there is going to be another term del\nt.\nSo, you remember this was a typical Bernoulli’s\nequation to make it unsteady we add another\nterm this is unsteady part. So, to derive\nthe dynamic free surface boundary condition\nwe use when we make use of the unsteady Bernoulli’s\nequation here rho n is constant and usually\ntaken as gauge pressure that is 0 atmospheric\npressure, but we take it Pn = 0. Now, if there\nis a wavelength of very I mean in wavelength\nor very short that the surface is no longer\nfree.\nYou have to ride the dynamic free surface\nboundary condition for this case where surface\ntension tease important. So, to be able to\ndo that, you know, I will solve the dynamic\n3 surface boundary condition in this case.\nConsidered as a surface for which the curvature\nexists n is as shown below here all. So, this\nis T this is T and this is alpha and the gauge\npressure is Pn and we have considered this\ndistance delta x all. So, if you denote P\nas the pressure under the free surface and\nfree body analysis in vertical direction,\nso, we have to do the free body analysis in\nthe vertical direction. So, this is the direction\nvertical direction v direction. So, we can\nwrite t - sine alpha because this will have\ncomponent here and sine alpha + sine alpha\nat this point, you know.\nBecause this is negative this will be positive\n+ because of this pressure difference P - P\nn into delta x + different terms of delta\nx is squared. So, here we assume that delta\neta by delta x = sine alpha all how \nyou see this is so, this will be at this point\nthere will be eta and there will be point\neta. So, the difference between them del eta\nby del x will be sine alpha all or we can\ntake this 1 also as delta x because we are\nconsidering very small. So, here we take delta\neta by delta x = sine alpha.\nSo, if we expand it using the Taylor series\nand allow delta x going to 0, we will get\nP = P n - sigma dash is nothing but T del\nsquare eta by del x squared, if you put sin\na del eta del x at sin alpha this is what\nwe are going to get. So, therefore, the dynamic\n3 surface boundary condition becomes. So,\nwhat we have done we have just prescribed\nPn you see P total pressure therefore, it\nbecomes Pn by rho -. So, instead of P here\nin the dynamic preface boundary condition.\nWe find put the pressure here and the rest\nof the things remains same you see, so, this\nis u squared this is v squared + P by rho.\nSo, that becomes Pn by rho - sigma dash or\nT by rho into Del squared eta by del x squared\n+ z = c of t. This was a very simple example.\nYou must have prior knowledge of the surface\ntension from before to be able to do that\nhow to apply this problem, but this is just\na way of showing the dynamic face surface\nboundary condition.\nNow, another boundary condition that is called\nlateral boundary condition. Until now, we\nhave discussed bottom boundary condition for\nbottom and upper surfaces. So, bottom boundary\ncondition the at the top we have discussed\nabout kinematic free surface boundary condition\nand dynamic free surface boundary condition,\nbut the but there are many other surfaces\nthis is also one of the boundary. So, these\nwe must also specify the remaining lateral\nboundary conditions.\nSo, let us say one of the conditions could\nbe if waves are propagating in x direction\nthat means, by the sentence itself this means\nthere is no flow in y direction. Therefore,\nthe no flow in y direction is 1 lateral boundary\ncondition. In next direction if motion occurs\ndue to a paddle or the wave maker then we\ncan apply the usual kinematic boundary condition\non this side. So, the waves are being generated\nhere. So due to a paddle here so, the boundary\ncondition at this surface we can apply similar\nto like the kinematic boundary condition no\nchanges.\nSo, consider a vertical paddle if the displacement\nof the paddle is described as x is a function\nof s z, t the question is find the kinetic\nboundary condition. So, this is x is a function\nof z, t this is the paddle, so, the movement\nis the next direction of the paddle therefore,\nwe say x = a function of z, t so with this\nsurface equation x - s z, t = 0 are F you\ncan use the similar analysis of the kinematic\nboundary condition.\nyou remember u dot n = - del x del t by mod\ndelta F all the same thing you will get another\nlateral boundary condition could be for the\nwaves that are periodic means, they have a\nwave period and it repeats in space and time.\nSo, for the waves that are periodic in space\nand time the boundary condition can be simply\nrepresented as, phi as phi of x, t will be\nsame as x + L where L is the wavelength.\nThis is periodic boundary condition in space,\nthe other could be it will be same as at t\n+ delta T. So, this capital T is wave period\nyou would get to know what wavelength and\nwave period are soon, but to complete this\nboundary condition description, I think this\nis quite an important thing.\nNow, after reading the boundary condition,\nwe are getting straight to the derivation\nof the velocity potential to derive the velocity\npotential there are some assumptions, we started\nthis chapter I mean this module by saying\nthat it is irrotational flow. So, following\nare the assumptions of deriving the expression\nfor the velocity potential phi that has much\nto do with the hydraulic engineering or fluid\nmechanics.\nAnd it could be due to anything in our current\ncase that are due to the propagating ocean\nwaves are that the flow is irrotational all,\nfluid is ideal surface tension is also neglected\nand the pressure at free surfaces uniform\nand constant also the seabed is rigid horizontal\nand impaired may well these are some of the\ntop most top 5 condition and this ideal in\ninviscid flow total ideal conditions we have\nassumed all.\nNow, we also assume some additional conditions\nthat wave height is small compared to the\nlength. So, we see yes, you see. So, this\nis let us say amplitude = wave height by 2\nfor this wavelength lambda by 2. So, we say\nthis lambda by 2 is much larger than h by\n2 this is not a very good representation,\nbut just to let you know that we will follow\nthis derivation we will assume wave height\nis small compared to its length we will come\nto why the potential flow theory is applicable,\nbecause we have assumed the ideal fluid.\nTherefore, under the ideal conditions like\nthis a velocity potential phi exists and the\nvelocity component u and w in the x and z\ndirections can be obtained as del phi del\nx and del phi del z. So, we have assumed that\nthe flow is occurring into direction x and\nz therefore, there will be only 2 velocity\ncomponents, u and w and if we know phi we\ncan obtain u as del phi del x and w as del\nphi del y.\nSo, the governing equation so we do go back\nand remember what we learned in the Laplace\nequation the Laplace equation was we go back\nand listen to remember try to remember the\nboundary conditions. There we said first we\nestablish a region of interest that we have\nalready done ocean surface waves or oceans\nare the region of interest. Now, we must find\nthe equation that satisfy that should be satisfied,\nbecause of the assumptions we have taken.\nIn the current scenario, we can assume that\nLaplace equation is that governing equation\nwhich will be satisfied. So Laplace equation\nfor phi can be return as delta squared phi\n= 0 for our current case. The continuity equation\nand the Bernoulli’s equation are used in\nthe solution procedure. So this is the continuity\nequation del u del x + del v del y + delta\nw delta z = 0 and also the unsteady Bernoulli’s\nequation for the boundary condition,\nYou remember the dynamic resurface boundary\ncondition. So, these are the 3 equations that\nare used for the solution procedure all.\nNow, the boundary conditions equation 2.1\nyou know this Laplace equation is to be satisfied\nfrom the water depth if we say the water depth\nis - d to the free surface of the wave. So,\ntry to I mean you see. So, origin is at free\nsurface so, this should be satisfied. This\nis eta and this is z should be satisfied from\n- d to eta and we have considered the entire\nocean so x will be - infinity to + infinity.\nHere eta is the water surface elevation measured\nfrom Stillwater level if this is a still water\nlevel.\nSo, this is a top because below is the depth\nhere is the eta, eta is the water surface\nelevation measured from still water level\nthis is SWL, the kinematic boundary condition\nmeaning that the vertical velocity component\nat the sea bottom is 0 because at the sea\nbottom the we already seen that w should be\n0. This is one of the condition and the pressure\nat free surface is 0 atmospheric pressure\nbut we have assumed it to be gauged pressure\nPn = 0 at z = eta, these are the boundary\nconditions.\nNow, if you linearize the Bernoulli’s equation,\nso linearizing means taking out the second\norder term. So, we take out u squared + w\nsquared because those are quite small at the\nfree surface. So, this is the linearized boundary\ncondition that we linear linearized Bernoulli’s\nequation that we get.\nSo, when the height will be z = eta that means,\nthat free surface if we take phi = 0 equation\nin equation 2.4 we are going to get eta = 1\nby g del phi del t at z = eta. So, in terms\nof velocity potential we have obtained by\nlinearizing the Bernoulli’s equation we\nhave obtained you see why we have assumed\nu squared + w squared = 0. You see at the\ntop there will be no velocity of the fluid\nparticle.\nThat is why it is going down under the influence\nof gravity that is why half u squared + W\nsquared is going to 0 all and that is why\nwe were able to linearize and avoid this term\nin here. So, this is the eta = So, eta which\nwas unknown from before using the dynamic\n3 surface boundary condition this dynamic\n3 surface boundary condition, we have been\nable to write eta as a function of velocity\npotential.\nYou see how important that tool was so, this\nis the dynamic free surface boundary condition\nsince we assume that the amplitude of the\nwave are small. See, 1 assumption was that\nthe amplitude has amplitude of the waves is\nvery small. So this eta actually is very small.\nSo we can also this is a problem if it says\nz = eta because we do not know eta from before\nthis becomes implicit equation. So with this\nassumption of that the waves being as small.\nThis data can be written as, instead of 0\n= eta we write z = 0 because eta is very small,\nso, it will be z = 0. Now, you see this is\nan explicit equation in eta of eta, where\nif we know the velocity potential, we will\nbe able to find \nand found by \nassumption of small amplitude. So, this has\nbeen founded by assumption of a small amplitude.\nSo, this is applicable only when eta is small\nand valid for these condition which you do\nnot have to worry about it now. So, I will\nshow you the definition sketch.\nSo, just describing see this is the sea bed\nz = - d this is still water level z is 0 at\nthis line. So, this is the depth - d. So,\nthis is the half of wave height or amplitude\nthe full way will be between the crest and\nrough whatever the height is wavelength will\nbe from this point to this point,. So, I think\nthis is a nice point to stop before we meet\nagain for the next lecture, where we start\nagain by describing very basic properties\nof this basic sketch of the way of motion,\nthank you so much. See you in the next lecture.",
    "video_48": "Welcome back students for this third lecture\nof this module, where we are deriving the\nvelocity potential of the ocean surface waves.\nLast time we concluded with this particular\nslide indicating the definition sketch of\nthe wave motion, where we have told you what\nthe water depth is this figure is actually\nvery important for understanding how this\nlinear wave is represented. The wavelength\nis given as L at the top the depth is indicated\nwave height H is also given no sea bed is\nshown so we from this point onward will continue\nwith our derivation.\nNow we have listed the boundary conditions\none was w = 0 at the bottom second was we\nspecified free surface dynamic free surface\nboundary condition at the top. And now we\nstart with the solution of the Laplace equation.\nSo, Laplace equation in terms of velocity\npotential in 2 dimension, as we have assumed\nx and z is del squared phi by del x squared\nis a + delta square phi by delta x squared\n= 0.\nTo obtain the solution a very simple method\nof separable is used to obtain the solution\nto this equation which is 2.6. Our let us\nassume, main method of separable phi of x,\nz, t can be written as X bar as a function\nof x it can be separated Z bar as z, T bar\nas t.\nNow, if we substitute 2.7 this equation into\n2.6 because due to the velocity potential\nLaplace equation properties, we are able to\nseparate X, Z and T using the method of separable\nwhat do we get x double bar. So, x double\nprime bar Z bar and T bar + X bar Z double\nprime whole bar and T bar = 0. Here each prime\ndenotes differentiation once with respect\nto the particular independent variable for\ndouble means double differential. Now, if\nwe divide both sides by X bar, Z bar and T\nbar, we get X bar X double prime bar by X\nbar = - Z double prime whole bar by said this\nis the equation that we get.\nNow, see this is we let us say this is a constant\n- K square, then we can write 1 of the equations\nfrom this will come X double prime bar + k\nsquared x bar = 0 and the second one will\nbe Z double prime bar - k square z bar = 0,\nthese 2 are very famous equation the solution\nfor this is standard. So, x bar from 2.8 can\nbe written as A cos k x + B sine k x. Whereas\nZ from equation number 2.9 solution to this\ntype of equation is here solution to the equations\nof type 2.9 is this one from equation 2.9.\nWe get X bar and Z bar so, we can simply write\nso, you see we had the solution that we all\ninitially assumed was phi x, z, t is X bar,\nZ bar and T bar so we can write instead of\nX bar we can write this one instead of Z bar\nwe can read this one and T bar remains as\nT bar.\nNow, the solutions to phi are simple harmonic\nin time, that is, because we know from previous\nthat they are waves and periodic in time.\nTherefore, T bar can be simply replaced as\ncos t or sigma t anything it can be replaced,\nand therefore with each of the values of sin\nt or sigma t, we have 4 forms of phi one will\nbe A cos k x multiplied by sin, the other\nwould be A cos k x multiplied by cos. The\nother would be B sin k x multiplied by sin\nand then the third the fourth one would be\nB sin k x multiplied by sin.\nSo we can write 4 different terms A1 we did\nnot touch this, so A cos k x + B sin k x multiplied\nby either sin sigma t or cos sigma t. There\nare going to be 2 terms when we assume t as\na function of sin sigma t, and they would\nnot mean after multiplication with this and\nthere will be 2 other term is if instead of\nsin we assume cos t bar T. So total we can\nwrite 4 terms, phi 1 will be A1 into C e to\nthe power k z cos k x cos sigma t. Another\nthing would be A2 C e to the power k z + D\ne to the power - k x sin k x sin sigma t.\nThe third would be sine k x cos sigma t and\nfourth would be cos k x sin sigma t. However\nthe total velocity potential is going to be\nsome of 2 of those which one we will come\nto it later. But for now, we have assumed\n4 different terms phi 1 phi 2 phi 3 phi 4,\n1 would be phi 1 - phi 2 the other could be\nphi 3 - phi 4, but that will come to later.\nSo, we have to see this these terms phi 1,\nphi 2, phi 3, phi 4 are constants A1, C, D,\nsigma is related to the time period case rate\nto the wave period that will come to it later.\nBut more importantly we have to find these\nconstants A1, C and D. So, how did it remind\nthese constants, the constants are determined\nusing the dynamic free surface boundary condition\nand the kinematic bottom boundary condition\nas you would remember, because, by the definition\nof the boundary condition, we said that, there\ncould be infinite number of solutions to a\ngoverning equation?\nHowever, with the application of boundary\ncondition, we can find one or more unique\nsolutions to the problem that is what we are\ngoing to do. These constant will be determined\nfrom the boundary Conditions let us consider\nphi 2 is one velocity potential that we have\nwritten here this one. So, what does it say\nphi 2 is A2 into C e to the power k z + D\ne to the power - k z into sin k x into sign\nsigma t we call this equation number 2.10.\nIf we apply the kinematic bottom boundary\ncondition, which means fields the velocity\npotential W is given by del phi del z and\nthat will be 0 at z = - d. If you apply that\ndel phi del z at z = - d it will be A2 into\nC e to the power - k d - D k e to the power\nk d into sin k x sin sigma t = 0 = - d. So,\nnow there is no Z but instead of Z we have\nd. So, A2 is not equal to 0 otherwise there\nis not going to be any wave also sin k x sin\nsigma t will not be 0 because there will be\na velocity potential if we substitute them\nto be either one of them to be 0 the velocity\npotential becomes 0.\nSo that means these 3 terms cannot be 0. Therefore,\nthe only thing is that this be 0 and if we\nutilize this we are going to get C as D into\ne to the power k d. So with one boundary condition\nwe have reduced our unknown by 1 number. C\n= we have related C and D.\nNow \nif we substitutes for C in equation 2.10 so\ninstead, of CV put 2d into what the term that\nwe have got we are going to get phi 2 = 2\nA2 D into e to the power k d \ninto sin k x sin sigma t or simply we can\nwrite this is nothing but cos h k d + z. Simple\ntrigonometry.\nSo, we have got phi 2 is 2 A2 into D e to\nthe power k d cos h k d + z so we are left\nwith A2 and D for now. And if we do del phi\ndel t at Z = 0. We get 2 A2 D sigma e to the\npower k d cos h k d sin k x cos sigma t and\non assuming if we assume that free surface\nelevation is A sin k x into cos sigma t. So,\nwhat we are going to do here is the wave amplitude\nthat is H by 2 this is our assumption and\nby applying the free surface boundary condition\nthat eta = one by g del phi 2 del t and Z\n= 0.\nSo, first we are applied the bottom boundary\ncondition. On the second step we want to apply\nthe dynamic free surface boundary condition.\nSo, for applying the dynamic free surface\nboundary condition we need to calculate this\nterm one by g del phi 2 del t at Z = 0. And\nthis is what we get this term and this we\nequate to eta is the free surface which = A\nsin k x into cos sigma t.\nSo simply what we do eta = and after solving\nfor this we get 2 A2 D e to the power kd is\nag by sigma into 1 by cos h k d. And if we\nsubstitute these values into our original\nphi 2 we are going to get it as phi 2 = ag\nby sigma cos h k d + z cos h k d into sin\nk x into sin sigma t. So, we have now, first\nwhat we did we solve for Laplace equation\napplied the 2 boundary conditions and obtain\nthe value of the velocity potential phi 2\nwhich is of the form ag by sigma into cos\nh k d + z into cos h k d sin k x into sin\nsigma t.\nSo, sigma is 2 pi by T and k is 2 pi by L\nthis is wavelength and this is time period\nfor you the derivation is not important what\nthe results are, but the derivation is important\nin a way that it makes you appreciate how\nstarting from the basics we can derive these\nequations they will ask the potential.\nI do not expect you to remember the derivation\nbut the steps you must know the things like\nthe specifying the governing equation, what\nare the governing equations governing equation\nis Laplace equation for the boundary conditions\nwe utilize the Bernoulli’s equation and\nthe continuity equation for example, so, we\nhave obtained phi 2 here.\nSo, if we consider phi 3 and apply the same\nconcepts that phi 3 = you know, we apply the\ndynamic boundary condition. This will give\nC equal to D into e to the power 2 k d.\nAnd same procedure is repeated for the dynamic\nfree surface boundary condition and we get\nfor phi 3 at term like this, you understand\nsame procedure. So phi 3 we get - ag by sigma\ncos h k d + z similarly, we get phi 3. And\nsame procedure we do for phi 4, for obtaining\nthe values.\nAnd what we get phi 4 is ag by sigma a similar\nresult we get and we repeat the same procedure\nagain for phi 1.\nApplying the kinematic bottom boundary condition\nfirst and then applying the dynamic. See I\nam skipping because it is essentially the\nsame process.\nMore \nimportant is this term so phi 1 we get is\n- ag by sigma cos h k d + z if you remember,\nphi 2 and phi 4 was positive with a positive\nsign phi 4 and phi 1 was with the negative\nsign after the derivation. Now you remember\nI said that the total velocity potential will\nbe the summation of the two terms. So our\nvelocity potential is going to be phi 2 - phi\n1, or also in terms of phi 3 and phi 4 also\nso this becomes, so if you add to velocity\npotential, this was you know, phi 2.\nAnd, this one with a negative sign was phi\n1 so, we get this so, cos k x cos sigma t\n+ sin k x sin sigma t can be return as cos\nk x - sigma t using trigonometry. So, the\nfinal velocity potential with the value I\nmean the formula for which you are supposed\nto remember is this 1 ag by sigma cos h k\ninto d + z divided by cos h k d into cos k\nx - sigma t this is the final velocity potential.\nSo, now if you see we have determined phi\nis the amplitude of the wave.\nSigma is 2 pi by t k is 2 pi by L everything\nyou know. So, as a function of x we have found\nout the velocity potential here as I said\nthis is the expression for the velocity potential\nfor a propagating wave in a constant water\ndepth. So, this is at one particular constant\nwater depth, this is the velocity potential\nwhich we have derived from hydraulic assumptions\nand conditions.\nNow, because we have got the velocity potential\nwe can finally write the term for eta, we\nare going to check so, eta can be return as\nso, 1 by g ag by sigma, so, del phi del t\nat z = 0 will come out to be this one. So,\nag can be return as so, if you just g and\ng will cancel sigma and sigma will cancel.\nSo, at z = 0, this will also get canceled.\nSo, simply we left with n = a sine k x - sigma\nt.\nSo, now this eta is periodic in x and t, if\nwe locate a point and traverse along the wave\nsays that at all time t, our position relative\nto the waveform remains fixed. So, basically\nthis term k x - sigma from your earlier mechanics\nclass you would know this is what this is\nthe phase k x - sigma t. So, with this phase\nwe do x an experiment what we do is if we\nlocate a point and traverse along the waves\nsuch that at any time t our position relative\nto the waveform remains fixed.\nThen this means that k x - sigma t will be\n0 phase difference is going to be 0 which\nmeans that k x - sigma t is going to be constant.\nBecause if phase will be constant phase difference\nis going to be 0.\nAnd the speed with which we must move to accomplish\nthis will be given by k x - sigma t = constant\nor k x = sigma t + constant. On differentiating\nwe can get this equation we differentiate\nwe get k dx dt = we differentiate with respect\nto time = sigma or dx by dt can be written\nas sigma by k, and sigma was nothing but 2\npi by T and k was nothing by 2 pi by L. So,\nit is become L by T and that is the C and\nC is the wave celerity.\nSo, to determine the velocity of the wave,\nthis is the so, this is how the wave celerity\nthat is length wave length by time period\nis the celerity and this is the basis of finding\nthe way of celerity that if locate a point\nand traverse along the wave such that at all\ntime t our position relative to the waveform\nremains fixed when this will happen when we\nare going to move with the speed of the wave.\nAnd that our speed and wave speed will be\nthe same in that case and that is what we\nhave found out that C = L by T is the celerity\nof the wave with which we must be moving.\nNow, if there is a wave that is moving in\nx direction, then we can simply write the\nvelocity potential phi - = phi 2 + phi 1 not\n- phi 1 and then we will get nothing but with\n- sin - ag by sigma cos h k x sigma k x +\nsigma t into cos h k d. So, what you do is\nyou do x = so, instead of k x + - sigma t\nbecomes cos k x + sigma t. So, this is a different\nwaveform. So, in this case, since a eta is\n1 by g we will also get a similar you know,\nif there was it will remember it was k x - sigma\nt it becomes k x + sigma t. So, the phase\nis changing when the wave is traveling in\nthe negative direction.\nNow, to obtain the celerity of the wave in\nthis case we have k x + sigma t = constant\nsame procedure is repeated. So, it will become\n- c sonic wave negative means negative celerity\nin the negative x direction.\nNow, one important thing after this derivation\nof the velocity potential is something called\na dispersion relationship that is one of the\ncore concept of the wave mechanics. So, the\nrelationship between wavelength with period\nand water depth is obtained as given below\nfor the dispersion relationship, the main\nassumption while establishing the relationship\nis that since we are dealing with small amplitude\nwaves, meaning that the slope of wave profile\nare so, small that del eta by d eta by dt\ncan be approximately said equal to the vertical\ncomponent of the velocity w.\nSo, w can be written as d eta dt or in differential\nform del eta del t + w is what del eta by\ndel t because that is the vertical velocity\ncorrect d eta dt. So, that if you apply the\ntotal you know, differentiation by you know,\ntotal differentiation, it will be del eta\ndt + del eta by del x to del x dt. So, wave\nslope being small means del eta by del x = 0\nwhich implies d eta by dt = del eta by del\nt.\nW = del eta del t but w also equal to - del\nphi del z in form of velocity potential hence\ndel eta by del t equal to - del phi del z\nwe know the velocity potential we know the\nequation of a eta, if we do the differentiation\nof a eta we get del t = one. So, if you do\nthe differentiating the expression of eta,\nwhat do we get? Del eta by del t = 1 by g\nyou remember, that term headset = 0 1 by g\ndel square phi by del t square.\nEta was 1 by g del phi del t at z = 0. So,\nif you differentiate this you get del eta\ndel t = one by g del t square phi by del t\nsquare that = 0 this is what it is written\nhere so, we substitute del eta by del t we\nget from here.\nWhere = be write capital A is where A is here\nis H by 2 into g by sigma divided one by cos\nh k d and w is also - del pi del z it that\nis - Ak sin h kd into cos k x into sigma t.\nAnd we equate this both these term A square\nsigma from the previous equation with this\none here from the previous page because both\nare same.\nAnd on canceling the common terms what we\nget is sigma square by g = k sin h kd divided\nby cos h k d and this is nothing but tan h\nkd. So, sigma square can be written as g k\ninto tan h k d. Here sigma is the wave angular\nfrequency equal to 2 pi by T and k = wave\nnumber which = 2 pi by L as we have seen before\nand this above equation can be written as\n2 pi by t whole square = g into 2 pi by L\ninto tan h kd. So, actually this is the famous\ndispersion relationship.\nSo, but is substituting since sigma and k\nin terms we get L by T whole square = gL by\n2 pi into tan h k d or C squared =, because\nit can be written as C square = g by k into\ntan h k d. So, the speed at which a wave moves\nin the direction of propagation as a function\nof what a depth can be given by equation.\nEarlier we obtained the velocity potential\nat constant depth but now we have found out\nthe speed of the wave as a function of water\ndepth.\nSince C = L by T, we get C = we just writing\nit in a different form. So C can be written\nas gL by 2 pi tan h kd, or L = gT square by\n2 pi tan h k d. Since the unknown L occurs\non both side of equation 2.32 it has to be\nsolved by trial and error because k is nothing\nbut 2 pi by L. So, if you this, you want to,\nso, this is the equation dispersion famous\ndispersion equation, sigma squared = g k tan\nh k d which you must remember \nand doing some no manipulation here and there\nwe can also write L = gT square by 2 pi tan\nh k d.\nAnd this is also a different form of dispersion\nrelationship and because this L appears on\nboth sides of this equation 2.32 this equation\nif needs to be solved will be solved by trial\nand error method.\nSo, I will stop at this point in this lecture\nand when we start the next lecture, we are\ngoing to study the celerity in different water\ndepth conditions. So, thank you so much for\nlistening in this lecture and I will see you\nin the next class.",
    "video_49": "Welcome back student to the fourth lecture\nof this final module about inviscid flow or\nwe are going to derive we everywhere actually\nderiving the equations of velocity potential\nhere. So, to proceed forward, we are going\nto see we have already derived the dispersion\nrelationship. So, one thing you must remember\nthat the complex derivation you do not need\nto remember the only thing that you need to\nremember are the end results.\nFor example, the velocity potential phi and\nthe dispersion relationship. Now, whatever\nresults we have obtained, we are going to\napply in certain situations such as different\nwater depth. So, this is a table, but first\nwithout going into too much you know detail\nfirst I would like to say there is something\nwhich we have said deep waters, we have said\nintermediate waters and we have shallow waters.\nSo, what are the definition of deep water\ndeep water means that the depth of the water\ndivided by the wavelength in which the you\nknow the wavelength of the wave if it is greater\nthan half. That means it is deep water if\nthis ratio d by L is less than 1 by 20 or\n0.05. Less than 0.05 that the depth of the\nwater and the way the ratio of the depth of\nthe water to the wavelength of the wave it\nis less than 1 by 20. That means we are in\nthe shallow waters. And what the value in\nbetween 0.5 and 0.05 we call it intermediate\nwaters, that is our definition that is how\nwe have defined what a deep water is, and\nwater shallow water and what are the intermediate\nwaters are.\nSo, if in case of deep water, if d by L is\ngreater than half, then we will have 2 pi\nd by L will be greater than pi, what you do\nsimply is 2 pi just the d by L is greater\nthan half. So, 2 pi d by L will be greater\nthan 2 pi into half. So, this for Deepwater\n2 by l will be greater than pi. Similarly,\nfor intermediate waters this value is going\nto be 2 pi d by L will be between pi by 10\nand pi and for below that in shallow waters.\nIt will be from 0 to pi by 10 very simple\nto calculate yourself. So, for this condition\nwhen in 2 pi d by L is greater than by then\ntan h of 2 pi d by L can be approximated as\n1 you can use you are trigonometric calculators\nto find that for shallow waters if 2 pi d\nby L is 02 pi by 10 we can approximate that\nis 2 pi d by L So, tan h will go away whereas,\nin case of intermediate it will remain the\nsame 2 tan h 2 pi d by L.\nSo, these are 3 values of tan h 2 pi d by\nL that we get and this is the classification\nof ocean waves according to the water depth\ndeep water Intermediate water in shallow waters.\nLet us say the deep water condition in case\nof deep water equation 2 point 30 so, what\nwas equation number 2 point 30. So, equation\n2 point 30 was C squared = g by k tan hkd\nnow we go back to this. So, c not because\nsince tan hkd = 1 c not will become under\nroot gL not by 2 pi. And equation 2 point\n31 was we see not becomes gt by 2 pi or a\nlot can also be written using this equation\nhere, g by 2 pi T squared or we can also write\nL not is g by 2 pi is 9.8 divided by 2 into\n3.14 into T squared are lot can be written\nas 1.56 T squared.\nSo, in deep water if we know the time period\nof the wavelength can be simply derived as\n1.56 times T squared a very important result\nalso the wave speed c not gT by 2 pi 1.56\ninto it T. You see how we have applied the\nfindings into case of deep water.\nThat is when d by L is greater than half tan\nhkd approaches unity and the wave characteristic\nare independent of water depth. One important\nthing to note is that here the term d does\nnot appear in this equation because the term\nthat contained to d was tan h and this the\ntan h term goes to work in case of Deepwater.\nTherefore, all the way of characteristic are\nindependent of the water depth, this is an\nimportant result.\nSo, a lot is in FPS so, this is a different\nunit within SI unit which is the one that\nwe are going to use will be 1.56 times T squared,\nthis is the meter kilograms second unit SI\nunit. So, if equation 2.33 and 2.34 are used\nto compute wave celerity for shallow water\ncondition. So, if we say that we are going\nto use the same equation for shallow waters,\nwe are going to get some errors of the order\nof 20 to 50%., which is not good because we\nneed to get the correct value of the velocities\nin shallow water. Shallow water occurs near\nthe coast for example.\nNow, what are the shallow water conditions\nkd = pi by 10., that is what we said 2 pi\nd by L that is what we found out from the\ntable. Therefore, c square can be written\nas gL by 2 pi tan hkd then if k dan hkd can\nbe written as kd = 2 pi d by L. So, this will\nbecome C squared will become gL by 2 pi into\n2 by d by L right. So, 2 pi 2 pi gets canceled\nand c squared = gd same as what we have written\nhere So, C will is under route gd.\nSo, in shallow waters the waves speed will\ndepend on nothing but only the water depth\nin deep water it was not dependent on the\nwater depth button shallow water, the only\nthing on which the wave speed depends on the\nis the water depth if you recall this is so,\nsame equation \nas we got in open channel flow module remember\nwe got C = under route gd by applying the\nprinciples of continuity momentum and energy\nbalance.\nSo, in shallow waters wave speed is under\nroute gd where gd the depth of the water.\nSo, as I said this relationship shows that\nwhen a wave travels in shallow water waves\ncelerity depends only on the water.\nNow, relationship between d by L and D by\nL not if you divide the equation 2.31 by equation\n2.33 and equation 2.32 by equation 2.34 we\ncan simply get so, 2.31 and 2.32 are the equations\nwhich are general form 33 and 34 was doubt\nof deep water. So, if we divide those we can\nget C by C not = L by L not = 10 hkd. You\ncan try this on your own. Now, if we must\nmultiply both sides by d by L, we can get\nd by L lot = d by L tan hkd.\nNow, the relationship between D by L not and\nd by L and D by a not is given in wave tables\nalso. So, this is something if you want to\ncalculate there is something called wave tables,\nwhich I would not show you in this course.\nBut if you need to solve you can always use\ntrial and error method for solution of the\ndesperation relationship, but most of the\nquestion that you will be getting will be\nin your assignments will be based either on\ndeep water or very simple that you can use\nthe equations like there is present relationship\nor the velocity potential.\nWhere a lot of iterations and intermediate\nwater determination would be required, I would\nnot be giving those type of problems for you\nto solve, because the idea here is that you\nunderstand the basics of wave mechanics and\ntherefore, if I give you more questions about\nintermediate waters, it will only complicated\ncalculations. Therefore, the use of wave tables\nwill not be this is not encouraged.\nHowever, I can try to give you questions in\nyour assignment 1 or 2 which will show exactly\nhow to use the iterative formula, iterative\nprocedure. And I can also post some couple\nof questions in the forum. Where you are going\nto use those iteration method for solving\nthe wave amplitude or the intermediate water\ndepth properties.\nSo, this is the curve which is which denotes\nthe relationship between d by L and D by L\nnot. So, the right hand side then this shows\nd by L not.\nSo, see proceeding forward now, we have found\nout the velocity potential we have found out\nthe dispersion relationship now it is time\nto form find out the local fluid particle\nvelocities and acceleration under progressive\nwaves these So, in the evaluation of I mean\nfirst more importantly, why do we need to\nfind out these velocities and acceleration\nbecause in evaluation of waveform on offshore\nstructures, it is desirable to know the fluid\nparticle kinematics that is velocity and acceleration.\nWe know that phi = ag by sigma this we have\nderived this equation. The horizontal particle\nvelocity or the orbital velocity u is given\nby del – del phi del x, definition of velocity\npotential, so, we get ag by sigma k into cos\nhkd + z by cos hkd into sine k x - sigma t.\nWhereas, so if we substitute the relationship\nc squared = g by k tan hkd and small a as\nH by 2 because this is way of height and this\nis wave celerity We get u = H by 2 sigma C\nsquared K squared divided by cos hkd represent\nby sine hkd into sine k x - sigma t u it is\nenough if you remember the velocity potential\nequation because that you can differentiate\nand try to find out the velocities.\nMaximum you will be given, find out the velocity\nthat is that = 0 or at the water depth where\nis that = - d because though that is pretty\nsimple to calculate or maximum velocity when\nyou talk about maximum velocity, this will\nbe assumed to be one for the maximum velocity\ncase.\nSo, just doing manipulation writing in terms\nof l and t this equation you can remember\nbut not mandatory simplifying you will definitely\nremember the velocity potential equation and\ntherefore, you can know derive this U even\nfor your assignments and exams, so it is pi\nH by T cos hkd + z divided by sin hkd into\nsine k x - sigma t, this is the periodic term\nperiodic term in x and d sine k x - sigma\nt. And similarly we can find the vertical\nfluid velocity is given by – del phi del\nz.\nAnd therefore, we can you know similar substitutions\nwill give us - pi H by T sin hkd + z divided\nby sine hkd. Again, you do not have to remember\nthis but if you do it is no harm because more\nimportantly it is the velocity potential that\nyou must be remembering. So, w can return\nas - pi H by T sin hk into d + z divided by\nsine hkd into cos k x – sigma t.\nSo, the equation expresses the velocity components\nwith the wave at any depth z at a given z\nall the velocities are seen to be harmonic\nin x and t as shown in figure the lets you\nknow if we plot those its harmonic but with\ndifferent said you know this is the variation\nwhich we are getting if we plot those velocities.\nSo, figure 2.48 this figure it shows the horizontal\nvelocity component or the hyperbolic functions\nof the depth you see sine hkd + z hyperbolic\nfunctions of the pleasant and same with you\nalso you see one is U is in cos h k and this\nis in sin hkd we want w.\nWe say at any phase angle theta phase angle\nis k x - sigma t the hyperbolic functions\nof z that is cos h and sin h cause an exponential\ndecay of u and w with the distance down from\nthe sea surface, this is indicated schematically\nin this figure. These are just the findings,\nyou might you should not put a lot of effort\nand concentration and finding these values\nbut, I mean this is pretty true right that\nthe there is an exponential decay of u and\nw with the distance down from the surface.\nVariation of maximum u and w because cause\nand cause the you know if we take a phase\nangle fixed phi the whatever that is, that\ndoes not really matter because it will be\nthe same for different z the periodic will\nbe the same because cos theta or sin theta\nwill remain the same.\nSo here the phase angle is deemed to be 0\ntheta = 0, u = 0 and w is negative here theta\nis pi by 2 and u is assume u is positive and\nw is 0. At the top here theta = pi u is 0,\nbut w is positive. At 3 pi by 2 u is negative\nand w = 0. And if you put in the velocity\npotential and u and w equation, different\ntheta, different values you are going to get\nand the sign will be determined from there\nso this is just a summary of those results\nobtained from this equation more importantly,\nthis is theta = 0 starting from here.\nThis is theta = pi by 2 this is theta= pi\nthis theta will 3 pi by 2 and this is theta\n= 2 pi. So, phase is changing by pi by 2 from\nthis point to this point and to this point\nfinally. So, this is a variation of u and\nw with phase.\nNow, we have talked about the velocity similar\nway we should talk about acceleration as well.\nSo, a x is del u del t because u we have already\nobtained in terms of hd and cos h. So, we\nsimply differentiate 1 small sign becomes\ncost here with a negative sin. And similarly\na w will become pass will become sin with\na negative sin, here it was signed, so it\nbecomes cos and there was already a negative\nsign.\nAnd in a w this course was then and it becomes\nsign after the differentiation with a negative\nsign so, this expression for fluid particle\nkinematic reported above is for water surface\nderivation being a sine curve. So, we started\nwith a velocity potential where our time variation\nwas sin k x – sigma t. So, similarly, if\nwe assume a cosine curve, the velocities the\npi can be derived as sine k x - sigma t correct.\nSo, in this case eta will be a cos k x - sigma\nt, the u will change u and a x and w and a\nw, so, if we assume a different velocity potential\nyou remember we had to velocity potentials.\nSo, we started doing all the calculation with\nthe first velocity potential but instead of\nthe first day we started with the second we\nwill obtain this set of the wave kinematic\nparameters.\nSo we have studied the velocity potential,\nwe found out the velocities under the progressive\nwhere we have found out the acceleration now\nimportantly we have to find out water particle\ndisplacement is nothing but integral u times\ng T w times d T in extend that direction respectively.\nSo, the expression of individual horizontal\nand vertical particle displacement is integral\nu dt u we already know in terms of h before.\nSo, the final results comes out to be h by\n2 cos hkd + z phi by sin hkd into cos k x\n- sigma t. Similarly, the vertical displacement\ndelta z is given by h by 2 sin hkd + z into\nsin hkd into sin k x - sigma t these are the\nperiodic terms. So, once you derive the velocity\npotential everything can be found out. Now,\nif we say delta x = d cos k x sigma t k x\n- sigma t and we said D is h by 2 cos h k\nd + 0 divided by sin hkd and similarly.\nWe assume delta z is B sine k x - sigma t\nwhere B is a different quantity called h by\n2 sin hkd + z divided by sin h therefore,\nwe can right cos squared k x - sigma t is\ndelta x by d whole squared, let us go back.\nSo, what we have said is this is D and this\nis B. So, if we take D down so, it will become\ndelta x by d = cos k x - sigma t and if we\ntake D down here it becomes delta z by D = sin\nk x - sigma t. So, sin squared theta + cos\nsquared theta = 1 therefore, this is what\nwe have used.\nSo, what we write is delta x by D whole squared\n+ delta z by B whole squared = 1, this is\nin general what type of equation if D is not\nequal to be elliptical. So, this is an equation\nof analysts showing that water particle moves\nin in an elliptical orbit. So, we have proved\nparticle moved in an elliptical orbit. Here\nD is the semi major axis at the horizontal\nmeasure of the particle displacement and B\nis these semi minor axis that is the vertical\nmeasure of the particle displacement. So the\nvertical the particle displacement this is\nan important equation.\nNow we analyze this displacement in shallow\nwater. So what happens in shallow water for\nd by L less than 1 by 20 we have 0.05 we have\nused cos hkd + z and sin hkd + 2 sin hkd +\nz goes to k d + z and sin hkd goes to kd..\nHence, D will be what if we as you remember\nD was this equation D was h by 2 cos hkd +\nz and sin hkd in shallow water this becomes\nkd + z divided by kd. So this capital D becomes\nh by 2 into 1 by kd and B becomes h by 2 k\nd + z by kd hence the water particle in shallow\nwater moved in analytical orbit in shallow\nand intermediate waters with the equation\nof the form.\nIf discuss just simply substituted in shallow\nand intermediate shallow and intermediate\nwaters with this D and B but in deep water\nfor the case d by L greater than half D becomes\nh by 2 e to the power k d + z + e to the power\n- kd + z divided by e to the power kd. - e\nto the power - kd as D is very large e to\nthe power - k d + z and e to the power - kd\nwill be very small correct because this deep\nnow, so, if it - sin they will be very small\ncompared to e to the power k d + z. So, this\ncan be taken away.\nAnd therefore, we can right h by 2 e to the\npower kd + z divided by e to the power kd\nand simply h by 2 e to the power kz. This\nis important. Similarly, if we do the same\nprocess with B, we will again get h by 2 e\nto the power kz because deep water that is\ngoing to happen again. Therefore, you see,\nboth B and D are same. So, in an ellipse if\nboth the major and minor x is the same, it\nis nothing but a circle.\nTherefore, the particles move in circular\norbits in deep water since these equal to\nbe with the equation of the form delta x divided\nby h by 2 e to the power kz + delta z h by\n2 e to the power kz whole squared = 1. So,\nsee these things are very important these\nare the type of questions which you can expect\nwhat type of orbit in deep water then you\nhave to take mark the correct 1 as a circular\norbit elliptical orbit. This shows that for\ndeep water condition the water particle trajectories\nare circular.\nSo, you see, this is the representation the\nschematic representation of fluid particle\ntrajectories the amplitude of the water particle\ndisplacement it first of all it decreases\nexponentially along the water depth the water\nparticle displacement becomes small relative\nto the wave height at a depth equal to one\nhalf the wavelength below this still water\nlevel that is the deep water the variation\nof the water particle that displacement under\nthe depth condition is illustrated in this.\nSo, there is 1 last thing before the end of\nthis lecture, I have included in the slide\nbut does not have any significance for this\nparticular course. You see the dispersion\nrelationship, I said there are 2 solutions.\nOne is either using the wave tables and the\nsecond is trial and error. But some scientists\nlike hunt he came up with the direct solution\nfor kd. He said kd squared = y squared + y\ndivided by 1 + n goes from 1 to 6 dn Yn.\nAnd this final equation can be used in mat\nlab or Excel to determine for different wise\nso if you can put it on a computer code using\nmat lab or Excel, you the you There is no\nneed for you know, iteration or any other\nmethod. So this is just for information purpose.\nYou do not need do not need to remember maybe\nthe name you know the if somebody is interested\nin doing further research or going for a master\nis program or you know, something related\nto research they can use this equation as\nsuch. So, with this actually this equation\nis accurate for 0.1% for y going from 0 to\ninfinity.\nSo, I think this is a fine point to stop.\nIn the next lecture, we will conclude this\nmodule of invested flow that is wave mechanics\nand we start with the pressure distribution\nand the progressive waves from the next lecture\nand finish this module. And this will also\nbe the end of the course, but I will talk\nabout it in the last lecture of this course\ncalled hydraulic engineering. Thank you so\nmuch for listening. See you in the next lecture.",
    "video_50": "Welcome back student to the last lecture of\nthis module and also the last lecture of this\ncourse of hydraulic engineering, it has been\na pleasure interacting with you. So, to go\nahead and get started with this topic of pressure\ndistribution under progressive waves.\nSo, you remember we talked about linearized\nBernoulli’s equation, this equation is given\nby - del phi del t + p by rho + g z half rho\nsquared + half u squared + w square we that\nterm we avoided because of linearization.\nNow, if you multiply this throughout by rho\nthe above equation, then the pressure can\nbe given as you see, if we take beyond the\nother side it can be written as a rho del\nphi del t -.\nSo, let me take this so, we have multiplied\nby rho so it becomes - rho del phi del t +\np because rho gets canceled here + rho g z\nthat and this can be written as gamma. So\np can be written as if this goes on the other\nside, this becomes rho del phi del t and this\none becomes - gamma is it and this is the\nsame equation here. So becomes p = rho del\nphi del t - gamma z or + of - gamma z said\nthis is the dynamic pressure.\nAnd this is the static component depending\nupon only the water depth now, if we substitute\nfor phi was the velocity potential in this\nequation, what do we get? p will be so del\nphi del t will be written as gamma h by 2\ninto cos h k d + z divided by cos h k d into\nsin k x - sigma t - gamma z so this is the\npressure equation.\nWe already know that eta can be written as\nH by 2 sin k x - sigma t and let us assume\nthat cos h k into d + z divided by cos h k\nd. If we write as K p substitute then the\np this one can be written as see gamma H by\n2 this will be K p or H by 2 sin k x - sigma\nt is eta. So, we can write and K p we say\nthat K p is pressure response factor, then\nwe can simply write p as gamma eta into K\np - gamma z or p by gamma can be return as\neta K p - z.\nNow, it has to be mentioned that P was set\nto 0 to define the free surface boundary condition\nin Bernoulli’s equation if you remember,\nhowever, phi was determined by setting p = 0\nas is that = 0 instead of z = eta. Hence this\nmeans this particular equation is valid only\nfor negative z that if you want to suppose\nthis is the you know freeze this is the you\nknow freezer. So, this is that = 0. So, the\nabove equation is valid only in this region\nbelow. We cannot apply this here in this domain\nthe pressure no, because it was because we\nhad derived phi with certain approximations\nassumptions.\nSo, p by gamma is eta K p and I think this\nis one such equation which should be remembered\nK p is cos h k d + z divided by cos h k d\nand eta we already know it is a sin k x - sigma\nt or H by 2 sin k x - sigma t.\nNow, if you apply this equation 2.57 so, pressure\nat z = 0 is going to be p by gamma = eta and\npressure at z = - d so, this is free surface\nand this is at bottom z = - d at bottom. So,\nthis means, if you n by cos h k d + d we know\nthat it is definitely less than d + eta because\ncos h k d is always greater than one since\ncos so, under the trough at sea bed the conditions\nare z = at trough wave trough conditions are\nz = - d and eta = - eta. So, if we substitute\nthat K p is going to be cos d - d divided\nby cos h k d or 1 by cos h k d.\nAnd n in eta = - eta therefore, we will get\np by gamma = - eta by cos h k d + d which\nmeans that p by gamma is d - eta by cos h\nk d will always be greater than d - eta because\nthis is greater than one it is often needed\nto determine the surface wave height based\non sub surface measurement of the pressure.\nSo, for this message for this purpose equation\n2.7 can be represented as. So, if we have\nsub surface measurement techniques available.\nSo, we can actually you know calculate the\nn where n is the correction factor depending\nupon the period depth wave amplitude sector\nthis is for the people who are interested\nmore in practical. So, n is has been found\nthat should be greater than one for long period\nwaves and n should be less than one for short\nperiod waves and n = 1 for linear waves as\nwe have seen already.\nSo, the pressure distribution under progressive\nwave is given by this is crest wave crest,\nso, pressure distribution under wave crest\nand pressure distribution wave trough to this\nis the pressure distribution under a progressive\nwave. So, these terms is important d + eta\nd - eta by cos h k d - eta and d +. So, in\nquestions you can be given for example, this\ncurve and asked to label water what is this\nquantity and other things.\nNow, there is something called group celerity,\na very important concept. So, when a group\nof waves or a wave train travels its speed\nis generally not identical with the speed\nof the individual waves. So, if there is a\ngroup that is traveling, its speed is not\ngoing to be the same as it was traveling alone\nanalogy is if you run alone and if you run\nalong with the group of people taking everyone\ntogether the speed will be different.\nSo, if any 2 wave trains have the same amplitude,\nbut the same but slightly different wavelengths\nor periods progress in the same direction,\nthe result in surface disturbance can be represented\nas the sum of individual disturbances based\non the principle of superposition, so for\nwave train getting in deeper transitional\nwater the group velocity is determined as\nfollows. So, as I said, the superposition\nof phi I mean eta 1 and eta 2 says we can\nsimply write combined eta, T is eta 1 + eta\n2 = A sin k 1 x - sigma 1 t + a sin k 2 x\n- sigma 2 t.\nBecause we have assumed that the same almost\nsame amplitude different phases. So, using\nthe trigonometry we write it is 2 a cos of\nk 1 - k 2 by 2 x - sigma 1 - sigma 2 by 2\nt sin of this term, this is what we get using\nthe trigonometry. So the left hand side is\nk 1 - k 2 by 2 x - sigma 1 - sigma 2 by 2\ninto t.\nSo, this is a form of a series of sin waves\nthe amplitude of which very slowly from 0\nto 2 way according to the cosine factor. So,\nwe say this is the amplitude of the wave and\nthis is the phase and the amplitude varies\nfrom 0 to 2 or depending upon the, what the\nphase is here. So the point of 0 amplitude\nor nodes, because it will very slowly from\n0 to 2 and there will be 2 as well they will\nbe 0 as well. So, the point of 0 amplitude\nare called nodes. They can be located by finding\nthe 0s of the cosine factor.\nBecause if this is 0 that is eta T max = 0\noccurs when k 1 - k 2 when this the term within\nthe cos is pi by 2 or a multiple of pi by\n2. In other words, the nodes will occur on\nx axis at a distance as follows. If you see\nyou try to do that if you rearrange we can\nget x node here = x is here, just rearrange\nit will be 2 m + 1 pi by 2 2 will get cancelled\nfrom each side it will be k 1 - k 2 + sigma\n1 - sigma 2 by k 1 - k 2 into T.\nSince the position of all nodes in the function\nis a function of time and they are not stationary\nat t = 0 there will be nodes that so as we\nsee the equate this at time t = 0. So, we\nwill see there will be nodes at pi divided\nby k 1 - k 2 divided and then there will be\nnode at 3 pi divided by k 1 - k 2 if we start\nputting m = 0123 and the distance between\nthe node is given by 2 pi by divided by k\n1 - k 2 or L1 L2 divided by L2 - L1.\nSo, you can be asked to find out the distance\nbetween the nodes and this is an important\nresult that you can remember the speed of\npropagation of the nodes and hence, the speed\nof propagation of wave group is called the\ngrief groups already so, what we have obtained\nis we have obtained in the distance between\nthe nodes. So, now, if we find out the speed\nof these nodes, we can find out the speed\nof the propagation of the wave group and this\nparticular velocity is called as group velocity.\nSo, if we find the x node by dt is the wave\ngroup velocity CG. So, if you go to see x\nnode what was x node was here and if you differentiate\nthe x node by dt, this term on differentiation\nwill be 0 + sigma 1 - sigma 2 divided by k\n1 - k 2. And this is what is told here sigma\n1 - sigma 2 divided by k 1 – k 2 or d sigma\nby dk.\nBut, sigma is what K into C, KC, sigma can\nbe written as K into C 2 pi by L into L by\nT. So, CG will be d instantly instead of sigma\nwe write K into C and if we differentiate\nthis we are going to get so differentiation\nby no I mean if there are differentiation\nof a b a b is ad db dt + b + a + b da dt.\nSo, we have used this rule change rule and\nwe often c + k dc dk C remains C here and\nK in So, what we do we write k remain same\ninstead of dc dk we write dc dl into 1 by\ndK dL.\nSo, we are actually doing some manipulation\nhere \nwith terms here. And since k = 2 phi by L\nCG will be C + kV write to phi by L dC by\ndL into 1 -, so, into 1 divided by - 2 phi\nby L Squire or CG = C - L dC dL. Since C squared\n= g by K tan hkd from dispersion relationship\nand if we substitute this C here and do dC\nby dl as well.\nWe will get CG by C = n, where n is half into\n1 + 2 kf divided by sin h2kd. So the derivation\nyou do not have to worry about that much but\nthis equation is important or CG can be written\nas group velocity will be C by 2 into 1 +\n2 kd divided by sin h2kd this equation is\nvery important. Do remember you must remember\nthis equation so for deep water 2 kd divided\nby sin h2kd is 0. Therefore CG group velocity\nis C not by 2 C not is, these were solidity\nof a single wave. An important result that\nthe group velocity in deep water is wave velocity\nof similarity by 2.\nSo, group velocity is one half of the phase\nvelocity in deep waters. Further it should\nbe noted that the variables associated with\nsuffix 0 refers to deep water condition, wherever\nwe have ref put 0 that means deep water condition.\nAndy Porter celerity you already remember\n1.56 times the time period.\nThere is a table that shows the sum total\nvariations so sin hkd in shallow water this\nkd whereas in deep water it is e to the power\nkd by 2 cos hkd in shallow water is none and\ncos hkd in deep water e to the power kd by\n2 tan hkd kd in shallow water and deep water\nit is one this we have already discussed once\nbefore also in a different format but yes\nthis is a thing so in shallow water sign h2kd\nbecomes 2 kd. Therefore CG is going to be\nyou look at this equation sin h2kd will be\n2 kd so this 2 kd gets canceled. So it will\nbe 1 + 1 to 2 into half of so CG will become\nCG will become C and that equal to under route\ngd.\nSo in shallow water the group velocity same\nas the face velocities all this celerity of\nthe wave. So deep water it is C not by 2 whereas\nCG = C shallow waters and in for the normal\nfor the intermediate water you can use this\nequation C = CG = C by 2 into 1 + 2 kd / sin\nh2kd. This is actually for all the waters\nbut intermediate waters, because deep water\nin shallow water we have some approximations,\nbut intermediate waters we can use the same\nformula.\nNow what is wave energy? We have discussed\nabout almost everything. So, we have discussed\nabout the particle trajectories then we have\ndiscussed about you know this group velocity\nnow we must go towards wave energy. So, total\nenergy potential energy + kinetic energy.\nSo, in order to determine the total energy\nand a progressive wave the potential energy\nof the wave above z = - d with a wave from\npresent is determine from which the potential\nenergy of the water in absence of the wave\nis subtracted.\nSo, how do we determine total energy and the\nway we determine the total energy and we total\nenergy or the way when we subtract it with\nthe potential the water in the absence of\nthe waves so, we get the energy in presence\nof waves only. So, the potential energy with\nrespect to z = -d of a small column of water\nd + Eta high dx long and 1 meter wide can\nbe written as, so if we have a small column\nof water d + eta high, where dx is length\nand 1 meter wide potential energy will be\ngamma a x bar area will be d + eta into d\n+ eta by 2 into dx.\nSo, the potential energy will be gamma d +\neta whole squared by 2 multiplied by dx. So,\nthe potential energy of a small column of\nwater.\nThe average potential energy per unit surface\narea is going to be integration of gamma by\n2 into so, we have to average over the whole\nwave period and also average over the entire\nwavelength. And using the equation below you\nsee, we integrated and after integration if\nwe use n = a sin k x - sigma t we and then\nwe integrate and simplification we will get\npotential energy total potential energy is\ngoing to be gamma d squared by 2 + gamma a\nsquared by 4.\nHowever, this is the average potential energy\nper unit surface area of all the water above\nz - z = - d. Now, we should also calculate\nthe potential energy and absence of the wave\nand the wave is not there, when the wave is\nnot there then there will be no eta in this\nterm you see there was eta here. So, now,\nthis would not be there when there is no wave\nand we do the same procedure for finding the\ntotal potential energy and this comes to be\ngamma d square by 2.\nAnd the total energy due to the presence of\nthe wave will be the total energy - the energy\nthat are - the energy when the wave is not\nthere. So, this will become the average potential\nenergy this one came to be gamma d squared\nby 2 + gamma a squared by 4 and this one came\nto be gamma d squared by 2.\nAnd this gives us the potential energy due\nto waves is gamma a square by 4 where a is\nthe wave amplitude? You have seen how it is\nderived, but results are more importantly\nyou must remember the potential energy due\nto the waves is written as gamma a squared\nby 4. So, this was the assumption we have\nassumed, using this small particle we and\nby integrating over the entire wavelength\nand entire wave period we have obtained the\npotential energy.\nSo, the method was total potential energy\nwith wave - the energy water potential energy\nwithout waves gave us due to waves alone.\nNow we will also need to find kinetic energy\nit is very simple kinetic energy is half mv\nsquared, where m is the mass of the fluid\nand v is a result and velocity.\nFor 2 dimensional wave flow, we know it is\nhalf under route u squared + w squared into\ndM can be written as rho into dz dx for that\ndefinition here,, these are dx and under route\nu squared + w squared, so the average kinetic\nenergy per unit of surface area, if we integrate\nit over the entire wavelength and wave period\nwill come out to be it is a complex into I\nmean.\nIt is so many terms, but on you know, applying\nthe simplification of trigonometry, we can\nget if we apply these simplifications, you\nwill get these slides so you will have more\nyou know, it will be easy to understand. But\nmore important are the results.\nSo we can show that kinetic energy is gamma\na squared by 4 potential energy was also gamma\na squared by 4. Therefore, the total energy\nis going to be due to the waves alone is potential\nenergy + kinetic energy, the total energy\nis gamma a squared by 2. So, the average this\nis an important result again so the kinetic\nenergy value the potential energy and the\ntotal energy these equations you must remember\ngamma a squared by 4 and total energy is gamma\nsquared by 2.\nSo, the average total energy per unit surface\narea is the sum of average potential and kinetic\nenergy density is often called as a specific\nenergy density. You can also be asked what\nis specific energy density for example.\nSo, now we have studied wave energy it is\nvery obvious that we study wave power wave\nenergy flux is the rate at which energy is\ntransmitted in the direction of wave propagation\nacross a vertical plane perpendicular to the\ndirection of wave advance and extending down\nthe entire. So, the average energy flux per\nunit wave crest with transmitted across the\nplane perpendicular to the wave advances is\nwave power. And it is given as e into CG.\nThis is important CG is group velocity and\ne is the energy that we just derived. So,\nthe power is given as e into CG or in if you\nwant to write it in terms of celerity. It\nis e bar n into CG u did you saw that n was\nthis so, the wave power is nothing you reject.\nYou just need to remember the formulas e bar\ninto CG where e bar was gamma a Squared by\n2. So, for deep water you know that CG was\nhalf c not.\nn = half so, power is going to be half into\nC not for shallow water it will e into CG\nbecause CG is C only if you assume that the\nwave propagates from deep water towards the\nshore and the ocean bottom slope is gradual\nand there are no undulations and as parallel\nbottom slope because, you see the wave power\nis going to be conserved if the wave moves\nfrom 1 depth to the other. Because you see\nthis if there is no loss, it is average energy\nflux per unit wave crest rate.\nAnd if we apply the conservation of wave power.\nSo, you see this is any depth. So, e is gamma\na Squared by 2 = gamma is h by 2 whole squared\nby 2. So, this becomes gamma h squared by\n8 and CG V not. So, with the wave propagates\nfrom deep water to let us say any depth whether\nintermediate or shallow. So, wave power is\ngoing to be conserved correct. So, in deep\nwater, it will be gamma h not squared by 8\nh not indicates the wave height in deep water.\nmultiplied by we have already seen that this\nis going CG is C not by 2 and this will be\nequal to gamma h squared by 8 this is the\nway high at any depth where we want to calculate\nmultiplied by CG, this is what this equation\nis all about this equation so we are conserving\npower from deep water to any water depth.\nAnd if we substitute for CG as C by 2 into\n1 + 2 kd by sin h2kd.\nWe are going to obtain h by h not = C not\nby C into 1 by 1 + 2 kd divided by sin 2hkd\nor we can obtain h by h not = under route\nof because this is n this is n by I mean this\nis a 2n. Therefore, h by h not = under or\nunder route of C not by C into 1 by 2 n this\nis called Ks where n = half into 1 + 2 k d\ndivided by sin h2kd. So, the above equation\nis very important again this represents of\nphenomena which is called shoaling. And this\ngives the ratio between wave height at any\ndepth in the shallower waters compared to\nthe deep water wave height.\nAnd this relationship is obtained without\nconsidering the irregular variation in the\nsea bottom. And this ratios under root of\nC not by C into 1 by 2 n is called shoaling\ncoefficient or chaos. So, until now, you saw\nthat we had been able to obtain relationship\nbetween the water velocities and only kinematics,\nbut this is the only equation that we have\nstudied that if we know the wave height in\ndeep water we will also be able to calculate\nthe height it any depth to z.\nSo, a very important equation which you must\nremember the shoaling coefficient and the\nroot C not by C into 1 by and where C not\nis the, speed in the deep water which is 1.56\ntimes t. So, there are some, you know formulas\nto remember, but, remember only the simple\nones, the ones that I have already told you.\nSo, by equating the wave power, we have been\nable to obtain the wave height the wave height\ntransformation if the wave propagates from\n1 depth to the other depth.\nSo, the variation of different properties\nof a small amplitude waves are shown in this\nfigure you do not need to pay too much attention\njust we have plotted d by L C by C not k s\nand n which you already know chaos is the\nshoaling coefficient.\nSo, this is the last topic the derivation\nis outside the scope, but what you must understand\nis that when waves are in motion, the particles\nupon completion of each nearly an elliptical\nor circular motion would have an advanced\na short distance in the direction of propagation\nof waves, you can check it from those equations\nas well. Therefore, if they move ahead that\nmeans that the mass associated with them has\nalready moved forward correct. This mass transport\nis happening in the direction of the progress\nof the wave.\nAnd the mass transport velocity is given by\nphi h by L whole squared into C by 2 cos h2kd\n+ z divided by sin h squared kd. So, this\nis outside the scope formula I do not expect\nyou to you know, remember this particular\nequation, but more importantly the message\nis to convey messages that you must understand\nthat the mass transport happens and then the\nwave motion is there. Of course, you must\nremember that it is a function of edgy Squared\nfor example, mass transport is the function\nof h squared or you know is related to how\nI mean the end of the vein which is proportional\nto one quantity.\nSo, the mass transport speed is appreciable\nfor high steep waves and very small for waves\nof long period you can see this equation.\nSo, if it is a long wave, the mass transport\nis very less because, so if period is long\nthe length is long. It is the high steep wave\nwhich means which is directly proportional\nto h squared. So, the mass transport will\nbe high for long the higher waves.\nSo, this was the last topic of hydraulic engineering\nwhich we have finished now, and with this\nI would like to close the lecture and also\nthis course. If you have further doubts, please\ndo contact us and the forum or I will be appearing\nin some live sessions. Also, I do not know\nif you have something after the this lecture,\nbut if you have you can send email to my teaching\nassistants, or also post the question and\nforum. I wish you good luck for you are assignment\nfor this particular week. And also the final\nexams. Thank you so much for listening. Have\na great year."
